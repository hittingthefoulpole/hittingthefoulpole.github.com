Ron Gardenhire, the manager of the Twins, gets quite a bit of credit for being a good manager. Here at firegardy.com, we don't understand why.

He can't make a lineup.

He can't play anyone who isn't a middle infielder.

He doesn't understand the concept of the designated hitter.

And, worst of all, the most unforgivable thing in the world:

Nick Punto.

Here at firegardy.com, we'll be pointing out Gardy's repeated idiocy and explaining why he's wrong. Hopefully this will encourage people to stop calling him "a good manager," and encourage Wild Bill to replace him.
