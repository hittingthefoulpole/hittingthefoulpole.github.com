According to <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/">LEN3</a>, Jose Morales has been told he will start the season with the Twins in Minneapolis.   I think this is good news, as it is my opinion that Morlaes is a better player overall than Drew Butera.  Word out of camp was that Butera was stronger defensively, but Morales made up enough ground in that department in the last few weeks to earn the job.

On the bullpen front, the other Jose M, Mijares, was cut from camp and will begin the season in the minors.  This is a good move as well.  Mijares showed up out of shape, and pitched poorly.  Those are both bad things. 

Cuddyer is getting a sore index finger checked out, it is apparently just routine, but I stopped trusting the twins when they say someone is injured but its "no big deal".  Bonser's shoulder injury wasn't a big deal, remember.  A week late, "oops, he's done for the season, maybe his career, not the one to two weeks we initially thought.  Our bad".  Lets hire some new doctors, ones that DIDN'T go to Hollywood upstairs medical school.

As we are now less than one week away from opening day, it is snowing in Minneapolis.  This is why I will miss the metrodome.  Yes, Target field in the summer will be awesome, but target field in April and October (hopefully) will be miserable.  Is it against the rules to play the first and last months of the season at the dome?  I mean nobody will be using it.  I'm just sayin'.
