It looks like the A's are looking to move Joe Blanton.  According to mlbtraderumors.com the Reds have inquired and the price is high.  They say either Homer Bailey, widely considered one of the top pitching prospects in the NL. Or Joey Votto, Johnny Cueto, and a third player. From 2005-2007 Votto went from high A to AAA, spending one season at each level. In 2007 at AAA he hit 294/381/478 with 22 homers. His k's were high, but he is still an top hitting prospect. If memory serves he has a leg up for a starting job in the Reds outfield for 2008. That is insane.  Bailey is projected to be a contributor in the Reds rotation.  So either package demanded by Beane would include a projected ML starter.  Joe Blanton is a middle of the rotation starter, solid but not spectatular.  Would you give up top young talent for a young version of Kenny Rogers or Jimmy Key or Brad Radke?  Seems like the Reds would be dumb to make either of those deals. Bill Beane is like that kid in your fantasy baseball league who proposes really dumb, one sided, trades and tries to convince you its a good deal.  "Joe Blanton is set to have a dominant, breakout year, I swear! Give me Reyes and Cabrera for him. It will give you pitching depth."  Shutup Billy Beane.

Update: Joe C notes that the twins are not in conversation with the A's about Blanton.  Good.
