Well, that was a disappointing weekend.  We really needed to win all three of those games against the Astros.  They are simply not a good baseball team. 
<ul>
	<li>Kubel left Sunday's game early because he caught the flu from Mauer.  Or because he terribly misplayed a ball in right field.  You be the judge.</li>
	<li>Apparently we decided not to hit yesterday.  I was at the game and it was pretty painful to watch.  After watching the first I thought Perkins was going to have a line something like this: 4IP, 8 hits, 6ER.  He managed to settle down and gave up 4 runs over 7 innings. Not great, but considering how he started the game, much better than expected.</li>
	<li>Saturday's game really should be the final nail in the coffin for certain bullpen members.  I'm looking at you Sean Henn.  I say we pool our money and buy a plane ticket for Anthony Slama TODAY.  The front office/coaching staff can't truly believe the bullpen in its current state gives us a chance to win.  They do not.</li>
	<li>I was hoping this interleague stretch would be a time for us to string together a bunch of wins and surge above 500.  Instead we have decided to stick close to the 500 mark.  Bold move, Gardy.</li>
	<li>We have nine games on the road starting tomorrow night in Milwaukee, the to Saint Louis and KC.  St. Louis scares me a little, but we should be able to win the series against the Brewers and Royals.  That being said when we play on the road anything goes.</li>
	<li>Will any moves get made on this off day?  I would bet Ayala's days are numbered but I saw a stat that he pitches really well on the road, so we will probably keep him around through this trip. </li>
	<li>What are your thoughts on what probably has to be the most disappointing series of the year so far?</li>
</ul>
