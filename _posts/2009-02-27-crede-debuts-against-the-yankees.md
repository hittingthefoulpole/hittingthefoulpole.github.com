Today Joe Crede makes his debut in a Twins uniform, against the Yankees. <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/02/27/twins-yankees-batting-third-joe-crede-dh/">Here's the lineup</a>:

1. Go-Go, CF. 2. Casilla, 2B. 3. Joe C., DH. 4. MVP ‘06, 1B. 5. Cuddy, RF. 6. Young, LF. 7. Red-Dog, C. 8. Harris, 3B. 9. Punto, SS. Pitching: Scott Baker.

Obviously it's tough to put together the best lineup without Mauer, Span, or Kubel, but I actually like this one. I'm going to go ahead and overlook the fact that Gomez is leading off, and assume that the point is to get him as many spring PAs as possible. Having Crede batting third, in front of Morneau, is promising: I continue to hope Gardy's willing to push Mauer up into the 2 hole.

But this lineup <em>should</em> be able to score some runs, and I'm excited to watch them. Wait, what's that you say? The game is on at noon, and is <em>not</em> available on MLB.TV? Well what the hell am I paying you guys for?

Hopefully one of our readers is in Fort Myers right now and can give us updates on the game. I'm not confident that that's the case, but I <em>am</em> hopeful.

Oh, and I wonder why Crede's DHing today. Is his back okay? Just easing him in? Gardy prefers the defense he knows (Harris) over the unknown Crede? Absolutely not a big deal and shouldn't be given a second thought?

Yeah, I think that's the one. No big deal. Let's just hope for some solid hits.
