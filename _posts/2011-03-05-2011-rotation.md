Over the last few weeks, Ron Gardenhire has dropped hints as to who will be in the rotation. Pavano and Liriano are a given. He announced last week that Brian Duensing <a href="http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_17520067?nclick_check=1">will start</a>.  Today, after three perfect innings, Blackburn <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/117464643.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUgOy9cP3DieyckcUsI">secured a spot</a> in the rotation. By my math, that leaves Baker and Slowey battling for the fifth and final spot. Unless, of course, Gardy goes back on his word. Which is entirely possible.  So who should start the season in the bullpen?  I'd have to say Slowey.  Baker is playing under a 4 year/15.25 million dollar contract signed in 2009.

I don't see either as very useful in the bullpen, but it is nice to have an emergency starter.  I also don't think there is much of a market for either.  I like Baker due to his strikeout rates (7.82 in 2010) being higher than Slowey's (6.71 in 2010).  Baker has a slightly worse K/BB ratio (3.44 vs 4.00), but both are solid numbers.  I think Baker has better "stuff", so if forced to chose between the two for the last spot in the rotation I'm going with Baker.

What do you guys think? Is the battle between Baker and Slowey or is it more wide open than that?
