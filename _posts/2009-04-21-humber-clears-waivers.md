Phil Humber has <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/">cleared waivers</a> and will be sent to AAA Rochester to rejoin the starting rotation.  I don't think anyone really cares that this happened.  So we get to keep Humber, it is widely agreed that he might have been the most replaceable player on the roster.  I guess its not a terrible thing, he might be able to help Rochester win some games.  It also allows us to keep one of the pieces of the Santana trade, so in the off chance Humber turns out to be OK, we look a little better.  I think the fact that nobody wanted a young(ish) starting pitcher is kind of a testament to just how useless Humber is at this point.  The fact that not even the Nationals (Natinals?) wanted him has to hurt the confidence.  Oh well.  That's all the news after an off day. 

That and Mauer played in a simulated game yesterday and was 1-3 with a double and a walk.  He will play in a single-A game on Friday.  Lets hope he is back by month end.  As reader MarkW (and Gleeman on his <a href="http://bases.newsvine.com/_news/2009/04/21/2712749-joe-mauer-sees-first-game-action?category=sports">fancy new national blog) </a>pointed out,  if the Twins can be around .500 when Mauer comes back they will be in pretty good shape for the summer and fall.

Go Twins!
