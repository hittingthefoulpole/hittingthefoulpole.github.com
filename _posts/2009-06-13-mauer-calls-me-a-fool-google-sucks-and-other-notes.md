I'm just going to pop down a few notes today, about the recent games and some administrative notes about the site.
<ul>
	<li>Yesterday, right before the game started, I mentioned that Mauer has apparently been sick for a while, and it's coincided with an extended stretch of power-free hitting. He must read The Blog, because he promptly hit a home run yesterday. I love it when Mauer makes me look like a fool for questioning him. Perhaps I will start a new Mauer-criticism policy.</li>
	<li>I haven't been able to watch either game, unfortunately. I listened on Gameday Audio on Friday, because a) MLB.tv blacks out games for local teams, and b) for some reason, I don't have cable television in my cubicle. On Saturday, I was in the dentist getting stabbed in the face by a masked stranger. Let me just say this: if we hadn't won both of those games, I'd be ready to kill right now.</li>
	<li>Although I thought this was amusing. My dentist is in Wrigleyville, so on the way home my iPhone grabbed this photo:</li>
	<li><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-704" title="wrigley_driveby" src="http://firegardy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wrigley_driveby.jpg" alt="wrigley_driveby" width="479" height="640" /></li>
	<li>So that's when I realized that they'd started the game. I thought it was in a rain delay. Note that it's the seventh inning. Argh.</li>
	<li>Also, a little note about the site. I recently attempted to improve the speed of the Twitter feed at the top of the page by hosting it at Google App Engine instead of on one of my own domains (each of which are just as slow as this one). Google advertises that their platform is fast, and scales really high, and blah blah blah. Sounded like a good idea. Well, it seemed okay at first, though there were more failures than I would have liked. But then this afternoon it just completely shit the bed. My app on App Engine became completely unresponsive, and Google has thus far been completely unhelpful. So I say "Fuck this" and I'm through with trying to put the Twitter feed thing on App Engine. It has been pulled from the site for now. If there is popular demand, I may bring it back.</li>
</ul>
I'm glad we won the series, and hopefully we can complete the sweep tomorrow. And hopefully an asteroid doesn't strike the earth or something ... that's about the only thing that could possibly keep me from watching the game.
