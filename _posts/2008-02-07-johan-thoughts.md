Jim caple wrote an <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=caple/080206">article</a> about Minnesota sports teams losing their best players.  He has a pretty good point.  However, I really don't thinking losing Johan was so much a money thing as it was a number of years thing.  Word on the street is we offered him 5/100MM, but were unwilling to give him the 6 year extension he wanted.  It also seems the Yankees backed out too because they were gunshy about a lenghty contract for a pitcher.  I think it makes perfect sense.  For the most part pitchers have the biggest risk of injury of anyone on the field.  I know Johan is a special player, but I just don't think 7 years is a wise investment. Its one thing to give Morneau an 80MM contract, he plays on average 150 games a year.  But giving a player who plays once every five days a 7 year 150 million contract is pretty risky.  It didn't work for Kevin Brown, Barry Zito, Mike Hampton, it worked well for Randy Johnson for a few years, but isn't that the point?  Of all pitchers with around 100MM+ contracts how many were still worth 20+ million in the 6th and 7th years of their contract?  The Mets may view it as a wise investment, to have a good pitcher at 20+MM a year for 5 years, and dead weight at 20+MM for 2 years.  They view that extra 40MM as a sunk cost, or something.  When I sign a player to a contract I would expect the player to be effective for all the years of the contract and would consider it a failure if he was totally useless for the last two years of it.  Don't get me wrong, I would love to have Johan for 5 more years, but have more than 20% of our payroll in the last two years of his contract dedicated to him when he barely puts a jersey on in those two years?  Dicey at best.

I blame Brian Sabean for this.  What was he thinking when he gave Zito that much money. He was coming off a bad year, and he still couldn't cut it in the NL.  I feel a little bad for the Indians because CC should be able to get about the same contract as Johan, he is about a year younger, and just as durable.  His weight could become a problem.  The difference is, the Indians have a good chance to win next year, it should be a battle to the wire with the Tigers.
