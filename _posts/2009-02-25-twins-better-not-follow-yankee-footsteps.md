This season, the Twins will play in the third oldest stadium in baseball (behind only the Red Sox and Dodgers). It also happens to be one of the worst. But in 2010, we'll be in the brand-spanking-newest stadium in the league, and the news coming out about it is increasingly great. Excitement is definitely building.

But the Yankees are <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=8547">doing what they can to strike fear into the fans of teams with new stadiums everywhere</a>.
<blockquote>The Yankees deserve every pixel of bad publicity they receive over this, every blankety-blank karmic quantum of bad yankety-blank karma. My friends and I are hardly the only customers wronged in such a fashion; an informal discussion with a few other longtime Yankees ticket holders who write for various sites (including this one) reveals similarly shoddy treatment. Indeed, all of us who have something at stake short of a full-season ticket package are being screwed because the Yankees have bungled this so badly that they can't possibly fulfill the demand. So naturally, their impulse is to trample the loyal customers who helped carry them past the three million and four million attendance milestones over the past decade. This is a story worth illuminating, not only to fellow Yankee fans who may commiserate about finding themselves up the same fetid creek, but to baseball fans everywhere.</blockquote>
Jay Jaffe is absolutely right about this. The Yankees are ignoring seating requests and moving their fans' requested seating assignments to wherever they want (and to a more expensive, more distant, more obstructed location, no less). And they're making a take-it-or-leave-it stance that can't possibly make any of their fans happy. And bear in mind that these are loyal, long-time season ticket holders who signed up for their tickets at the new stadium as soon as possible.

If this can happen to Yankees fans, it can happen to anyone. All I can say is that the Twins had better not try to pull this kind of crap on their fans.
<blockquote>But just remember that if this is happening here, it can happen in your city as well. Even the green cathedrals of Wrigley Field and Fenway Park will someday fall to the wrecking ball, and when you emerge from the rubble with a lesser opportunity to visit your new ballpark, you'll have plenty of company.</blockquote>
You've got that right. It's getting pretty close to time for the Twins to show their fans that they respect and value their loyalty. Do the right thing.
