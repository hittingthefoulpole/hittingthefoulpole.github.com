Welcome to the new site!  I hope you enjoy it, and make sure to tell your friends who may have been turned off by the old FireGardy moniker.

In other news, I had my first fantasy baseball draft of the season last night.  It was auction style, and I had never done that before.  It was quite interesting, but I don't think I was as patient as I should have been.  I missed out on some good value picks (Kevin Slowey, and Scott Feldman to name two) late in the draft because I had already spent most of my $260 and was forced to scrounge up $1 players for my last 10 picks or so.  Here is the rundown of players I got and the associated cost.  They are in the order I drafted them, but that is essentially meaningless. Another thing to keep in mind is that instead of having 3 OF, we have to have 1 CF, 1 RF, 1 LF.

	<li>Chipper Jones- $9</li>
	<li>Tim Lincecum- $40</li>
	<li>Ben Zobrist (he can play roughly 35 different positions)- $30</li>
	<li>Joe Mauer-$36</li>
	<li>Brian Roberts- $16</li>
	<li>Cliff Lee- $18</li>
	<li>Nate McLouth- $9</li>
	<li>Ubaldo Jimenez- $19</li>
	<li>Johnny Damon- $11</li>
	<li>Aramis Ramierz- $17</li>
	<li>Michael Cuddyer- $12</li>
	<li>Kendry Morales- $20</li>
	<li>Jonathan Papelbon- $12</li>
	<li>Milton Bradley- $1</li>
	<li>Ryan Rabur- $2</li>
	<li>Joe Blanton- $1</li>
	<li>Felipe Lopez- $1</li>
	<li>Alfredo Aceves- $1</li>
	<li>Michael Wuertz- $1</li>
	<li>Tim Hudson- $1</li>
	<li>Derek Lowe- $1</li>
	<li>Phil Hughes- $1</li>
	<li>Jim Thome- $1</li>
</ol>
The pick that really put me over the edge was Papelbon.  He should rack up a fair number of saves, but I could have gotten two lower tier closers for that price, and not driven myself into "$2 max bid" territory.  If anyone has an auction draft coming up, I recommend you be patient, there will be lots of value picks at the end, so make sure you have a high enough max bid at that point to be able to take advantage.  I really like my late picks of Lowe, Hudson, and Hughes.  If Bradley can revert back to close to what he did in Texas in 08, he will be a steal.  I'm not counting on it though.

Does anyone else have any draft results they care to brag about/show everyone how much you suck at fantasy baseball.
