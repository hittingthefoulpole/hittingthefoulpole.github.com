Last night the Twins played the Reds in what seemed like it was pretty damn close to a regular season game.  The reds started some pretty legit major leaguers, and Homer Bailey was on the mound.  The Twins lineup card looked like it probably will against lefties (hopefully just really tough ones, because Kubel didn't start) during the regular season.  I'm just recapping from the box score, but it looks like everything went well. We scored 4 runs off a good pitcher, we only drew 2 walks (Mauer and Morneau-no surprise there), Slowey looked (in the box score) good, pitching 5 innings with 3 hits, no runs, no walks, and 5k's.  If that doesn't solidfy him a spot in the rotation , I don't know what will.  Rincon, Nathan, and Crain then completed the shutout.  Twins pitchers walked one batter all day.  Impressive.  Mike Lamb made an error, not shocking I think he is still getting used to the idea of being an everyday third baseman.  Harris and Gomez had steals.  Giving Carlos NINE for the spring, that is awesome.   He also had two hits including a double, raising his spring average to 267.  I think he pretty much has the job locked up.  Not much to harp on from this game.  The lack of walks drawn by the lineup is disconcerting, but not that shocking.
