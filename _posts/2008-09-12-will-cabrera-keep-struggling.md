Today JoeC points out a nice <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2008/09/12/next-stop-charm-city/">little tidbit</a> about the starter the Twins are facing today:
<blockquote>The Twins will face Daniel Cabrera, who continues to struggle with his control and has showed diminished velocity in recent starts.

Consider this: Cabrera has issued 85 walks this season. You can combine three Twins starters — Kevin Slowey (19), Nick Blackburn (31) and either Scott Baker (36) or Glen Perkins (36) — and only get 86.</blockquote>
Of course, that means Cabrera will go 7 innings, with 11 K's and between 0 and 2 BB's. After all, he does have quite a history of murdering the Twins, and the Twins have a history of ignoring an opposing pitcher's weaknesses and attempting to beat their strengths.
