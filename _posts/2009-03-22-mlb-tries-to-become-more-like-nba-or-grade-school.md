Just learned this: MLB is trying to crack down on players who wear their pants slightly too long.

Putting aside the fact that I prefer players who wear long socks vs those who wear long pants, it seems to be the style of the time. So it's not really worth raising a stink about it, I think.

So the league is doing this the right way, and treating all the players the same, right? They're telling stars like DOrtiz and Manny that they're going to have to shorten up their pants ... right?

Ha, if you thought MLB would consider it a good idea to treat its stars the same as everyone else, you obviously haven't been paying attention to the way the league operates. Ortiz and Manny can wear their pants however they damn well please, thank you very much.

But <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/03/22/twins-jays-postgame/">if Denard Span does it, it'll cost him $1000 per infraction</a>.

Span claims it was an accident, but I don't care. This is just idiotic. It's just as dumb as the NBA trying to require their young black players to dress like their old white owners instead of how they want to (and like their young black fans do). Except this doesn't even have the excuse of doddering-rich-white-guys-who-are-totally-out-of-touch-with-reality.

I can't decide if this is an individuality-reducing power play like school uniforms, or if it's a revenue generating ploy for the league in a tough economic time (kind of like those cameras that catch you speeding and send you a bill).

Either way, it's lame. And it's even worse that they won't enforce the fines for players that make a lot of money.
