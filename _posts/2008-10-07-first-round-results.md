Now that the first round of the postseason is over and we have to wait a few days before anybody plays baseball again (good schedule, Selig! Let's make sure there's baseball in November! And make sure none of the games end before midnight, please. I don't like being awake at work.), let's take a look back at how our predictions did for the LDS. And I'll also determine a winner!

(Note that my selection of a winner is unilateral, and my opponent, FunBobby, had no say in picking it. Just wanted to put that out there.)

<strong>Red Sox vs Angels</strong>

<em>sirsean: Red Sox in five
FunBobby: Angels in five
A. Higgins: Angels in five
spangler: Red Sox in four
Reality: Red Sox in four </em>

The Angels didn't show up in this one until they got to Boston and had virtually no chance at taking the series -- though they were a walk-off Lowrie base hit away from sending it to a fifth game. Looks like audience member spangler was dead on on this one, with a half point going to sirsean for getting the team right.

<strong>Rays vs White Sox</strong>

<em>sirsean: Rays in four
FunBobby: Rays in four
A. Higgins: Rays in three
spangler: Rays in five
Reality: Rays in four </em>

Everyone picked the Rays, with sirsean and FunBobby picking up a full point for picking the correct number of games; spangler and A. Higgins earned half points for getting the team right.

<strong>Dodgers vs Cubs</strong>

<em>sirsean: Dodgers in five
FunBobby: Cubs in four
A. Higgins: Cubs in three
spangler: Cubs in four
Reality: Dodgers in three </em>

This one was a bit of a surprise; only sirsean scored, picking up a half point for guessing the team, but getting the number of games wrong.

<strong>Brewers vs Phillies</strong>

<em>sirsean: Brewers in four
FunBobby: Brewers in five
A. Higgins: Phillies in four
spangler: Phillies in four
Reality: Phillies in four </em>

We clearly divided here between winners and losers. A. Higgins and spangler got a full point apiece for apparently being able to see into the future, sirsean was way too high on the Brewers, and FunBobby's pathological indifference to the National League came back to bite him.

<strong>Scoreboard</strong>

sirsean: 2
FunBobby: 1
A. Higgins: 1.5
spangler: 2.5

So the trophy goes to spangler, whose powers of prediction are unmatched! Congratulations!

We'll be back soon with LCS picks.
