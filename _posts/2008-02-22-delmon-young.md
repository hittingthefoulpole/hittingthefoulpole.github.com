There was another article in one of the twin cities papers today about Delmon Young's "Checkered past". Can anyone provide insight into what this consists of, besides the bat throwing incident?Â  I am convinced that he is just being lumped in with Dukes, and journalists aren't willing to do the leg work to figure this out. But thats just me.
