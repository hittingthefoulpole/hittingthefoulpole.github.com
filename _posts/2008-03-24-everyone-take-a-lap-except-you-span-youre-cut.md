Today was final cut down day for the position players.  And it looks like the last men standing are Carlos Gomez and Matt Tolbert.  Tolbert really came out of nowhere to earn the utility IF spot.  Good for him.  Nobody seemed to want it, so he stood up and took it.  Buscher was the early spring favorite, but just could produce for all of camp as he seemed to fade down the stretch. Tommy Watkins tried to learn to catch, but having one hit all spring doesn't make you a viable candidate, no matter how many positions you play. Although this theory is disproved by the fact that Nick Punto has a job. 

 LEN3 also is reporting that Liriano will be sent to AAA and Brian Bass will take the 12th pitching spot.  I got no problem with that, but I'd like to see Liriano up in Minneapolis sooner rather than later.  Maybe a month or two in the minors depending on how everyone else pitches. 

 7 days from today.

 UPDATE: The Twins have extended Joe Nathan for three years, with a club option for 2012. The average annual salary is 11.25 mil, and there is a 2 million buyout.  Not sure what the salary would be for the 4th year, or what the no-trade clause status is.  We'll get more info as it becomes available.
