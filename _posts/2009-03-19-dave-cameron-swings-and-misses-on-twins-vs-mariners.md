I know we've talked about it before, but Dave Cameron's look at the organizational rankings deserves another look, now that he's covered the Mariners (which is the team he roots for). He placed the <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/organizational-rankings-18">Twins at #18</a>, and the <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/organizational-rankings-15">Mariners at #15</a>.

Of the M's ownership, he attempted to claim that the meddling in the team's affairs including forcing them to sign Japanese players to lucrative extensions (due to the fact that they are Japanese, and the ownership is also Japanese) is a <em>good</em> thing. That Johjima's disaster of an extension is not a problem. That they "convinced Ichiro to sign a below market contract extension during the summer of 2007," when in reality they're paying him as a CF when he's really an RF (with <em>zero</em> power) and he's signed until he's 39 years old. If the Twins' ownership gets a C-, then the Mariners' <em>certainly</em> does not merit a B.

Both front offices are new, which makes his take on them interesting. His take on the Twins is basically "Terry Ryan did a good, if old fashioned, job ... but now he's gone and we don't know what Bill Smith is going to be like. Uncertainty is bad, therefore their front office situation is also bad." Conversely, the Mariners' situation is more along the lines of: "He's new, he's great, everything is looking up. Uncertainty is good, therefore the front office situation is fantastic!"

But by far the biggest problem in his analysis is major league talent. Of the Twins, he points out the entirety of our "core," saying: "Joe Mauer is an MVP candidate, Justin Morneau is a minor star." That's just about as pessimistic as you can <em>possibly</em> be about the Twins' major league roster, if you're looking at it from a forward-looking perspective. So, we're being pessimistic, right Cameron? Well, he talks about "a significant core of young talent - Felix Hernandez, Brandon Morrow, Jose Lopez, Jeff Clement, and Franklin Gutierrez are building blocks under team control for years to come."

Felix Hernandez looks like he's going to be a stud someday. Which is exactly how he looked at the start of 2008. And the start of 2007. And the start of 2006. He's definitely a great talent, but at some point he's going to have to put it together. Brandon Morrow is a talented young pitcher that they've been using out of the bullpen for the last two years, despite the fact that they ultimately want to use him as a starter; they're very excited about him, but he doesn't have much of a track record. He's only thrown 46.2 IP in the minors, including 23.1 at AAA (exactly half). And his ERA at AAA? It was 5.01 ... which is not exactly, you know, good.

Jose Lopez is a second baseman with a career OPS+ of a whopping 86. He put together his best season in 2008, with a .297/.322/.443 line that was worth a 104 OPS+. Jeff Clement is a "stud" catcher who's so bad behind the plate they're desperately trying to move him to 1B or DH. And he batted .227/.295/.360 last year for a 76 OPS+. The only way Clement is going to contribute positively in 2009 is if he doesn't get any at bats; which is likely given the aforementioned Johjima and his contract playing catcher, and Ken Griffey Jr playing DH. Frankling Gutierrez is renowned for his good outfield defense, and I expect that they're planning to play him in CF; too bad they don't really know what they're getting, since he's played just 29 games in CF in his entire career (they acquired him via trade from the Indians, where Grady Sizemore is entrenched in center). And also too bad that he can't hit. In 2008 he went .248/.307/.383, for an 80 OPS+ (his career OPS+ is 86). The only season in the minors in which he was able to hit adequately was his <em>third consecutive year at AAA</em>.

And this is the Mariners' solid core for the next several years? If that's their core, then to get the Twins' core you'd take Mauer and Morneau, and you'd add Denard Span, Carlos Gomez, Delmon Young, Alexi Casilla, Scott Baker, Kevin Slowey, and Francisco Liriano. Span is better than Gutierrez in the field, and can hit. Gomez is <em>a lot</em> better than Gutierrez (and everyone else) in the outfield, and looks like he <em>might</em> be able to hit (though he's already hitting just about as well as Gutierrez). If Clement is going to be considered a power hitter based on his minor league record, then Delmon Young (who is 2 years younger than Clement) should be considered a central piece of the future core of the team. Casilla is better in the field than Lopez at second base, is a year younger, and hits just about as well. In what sense can Lopez be considered a future star if Casilla isn't?

The Twins' rotation is filled with guys who are barely older than Hernandez and Morrow, and have demonstrated more success in the majors. If the Mariners have two young pitchers in their core, then the Twins have <em>five</em>. Oh yeah, and Cameron mentioned Liriano's health problems, and was pessimistic that he could get back onto the field and be effective. I think it's more than worth pointing out that Hernandez and Morrow have <em>both</em> had significant injury problems over the last couple of years.

It seems to me that the Twins' major league talent eclipses the Mariners' by a <em>wide</em> margin, and if the Mariners have <em>any</em> players in their future core, then the Twins have <em>NINE</em>, two of whom are legitimate superstars. (By which I mean, everyone knows their names, they were two of the top four MVP candidates this year, they're All Stars, batting champions, MVPs, home run derby champions. Those are <em>superstars</em>. Not an "MVP candidate" and a "minor star.")

I'm not saying, of course, that the Twins have nine members of their future core on the team right now. That would be absurd. But if these are the standards, then they do. And if that were the case, and we're evaluating teams in a forward looking manner, then there is no way the Twins don't have one of the best collections of young major league talent in the majors.

Cameron protects himself by saying this at the end of the article:
<blockquote>Oh, and one final note - I fully expect the “you’re a biased Mariner fan” claim to show up early and often in the comments section. Just so you’re aware, though, the historical complaint about my writing from Mariner fans have been that I’ve been too pessimistic about the team. So, while it will be nice to be accused of the opposite kind of bias for once, how about we try to rise above analytical laziness and discuss the organization’s strengths and weaknesses and get away from statements about the credibility of an author who writes something you might not agree with?</blockquote>
So now we're not allowed to claim that he's biased in favor of the Mariners. Right?

Well, I don't buy it. Given a more in-depth look at the situation, I think it's quite clear that Dave Cameron was wearing different colored glasses when he looked at these two teams.

We've already covered that we think the Twins are unreasonably low on this list, and in this article we've also demonstrated that the Mariners are unreasonably high. I just don't think his analysis holds up.
