I had sportscenter on the TV this morning as I was getting ready for work, and while in the other room I heard them start to introduce a highlight from the Twins-Red Sox game from yesterday.  I dashed out to the living room to check it out.  First they show Josh Beckett getting someone to pop out, and spend a few seconds saying how awesome he is.  Then they cut to some random Red Sox minor league outfielder making a mildly impressive catch in left on a Nick Punto sinking liner.  And finally they show Kevin Youklis hitting his homer.  It was the most biased highlight I have ever seen.  The only time a Twins player was mentioned was Punto because he hit the ball that was caught on an "amazing play".  It was total BS.   Granted, the Twins didn't really do much on offense.  We did turn four double plays, I'm sure one of them was cool.  I also realize that time allotted for Spring Training highlights is less than time allotted for regular season highlights, but come on.   ESPN really needs to stop catering to "Red Sox nation" and give even coverage to all teams.  In the age of fantasy sports, pretty much every team has at least a few relevant players (except maybe the Pirates).  People who play fantasy baseball are curious as to how their players are playing and watching game highlights on sportscenter is one of the best ways to do that. 

The Red Sox are probably my second most hated team in all of sports.  So you can imagine that I'm upset that not only are they getting tons of exposure on sportscenter, but it is at the expense of one of my favorite teams in all of sports.   What do you guys think, is this something that everyone notices, or am I just crazy?  Would this have happened if the Twins put on more of an offensive show or will ESPN do anything to talk up the Red Sox?
