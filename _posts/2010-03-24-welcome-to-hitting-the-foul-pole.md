This marks the first post that will live solely on the new Hitting the Foul Pole blog, and not be shared with the old blog. I think we're both happy to be here, and hopefully you don't mind making the trip with us. And how about that picture up there?

Oh, and also, Ryan McCrystal -- if that is his real name, which I doubt -- over at the ESPN TMI blog [asks if Mauer's contract is exorbitant](http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/tmi-mlb/post?id=1057). 

> According to Cot’s Baseball Contracts, Mauer is now the highest paid catcher in terms of average annual salary by nearly $10M. His $23M per year deal is 43 percent more than Jorge Posada’s current $13.1M per year deal with the Yankees. Anyone in their right mind would take Mauer over Posada, but is he 43 percent better? 

Well, in 2009 Mauer was worth 8.1 WAR to Posada's 3.9, and in 2008 Mauer was 5.8 to Posada's 0.8 WAR. Not only is Mauer at least 43% more valuable, he's not even the one who's overpaid.

What, you didn't think I'd let you out of this inaugural post without a little Twins-related quip, did you?
