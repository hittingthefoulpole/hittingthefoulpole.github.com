The Twins placed starting pitcher <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/08/17/the-pitching-staff-is-falling-apart/">Francisco Liriano </a>on the DL after last nights game.  He managed to give up 7 runs in 2 innings of work, telling Gardy he had "nothing left in the tank".  Not sure if he is physically or mentally done, but its probably both.  He will be replaced with the always entertaining Phil Humber.  Great. 

The Twins have exactly two pitchers who I can count on to get outs: Guerrier and Nathan.  They don't pitch early in the game though, so it doesn't matter.  Baker seems to be coming around, but does it really matter?  If we have 4 train wrecks and one decent pitcher in the rotation will that really help us make up the defecit in the division?  I highly doubt it. 

The worst part is that we are wasting incredible seasons from Mauer, Morneau and Kubel (and to a lesser extend Cuddyer).  What reason does Joe Mauer have to stick around if we can't surround him with the pitching we need to win.  I am in the camp that thinks he cares more about winning than the money (this may contradict something I have said earlier, but if you go back in the archives and look it up: fuck you).  How can the Twins upgrade their pitching this offseason?  It is clear there are problems in both the bullpen and starting rotation.  If Bill Smith takes the "well, our young pitcher will surely rebound from a bad 2009 and pitch well in 2010 so I won't change anything" course of action, then he might as well book Joe a plane ticket to the east coast.  We have to open up the wallet and probably overpay for some pitchers.  It is damn near impossible to sign a good free agent player to a team friendly contract.  When the Yankees signed Burnett to that 5 year deal, they probably knew he was going to be bad for the last two, but that is just the price you pay for talent on the open market.  I don't know what pitchers will be available this offseason via trade or free agency, but we need to take a good look at all of them.  I think we might have some bullpen answers in the system in Delaney and Slama, but as far as starting rotation?  There isn't too much in the minors that we haven't already seen.  Other than the Twins specialty, "projects to be a middle to back of the rotation starter at best, Phil Humber at worst". 

What do you think the Twins can do to upgrade this offseason.  Or, if you are the optimistic type, what can they do over the next six weeks to make a playoff push?
