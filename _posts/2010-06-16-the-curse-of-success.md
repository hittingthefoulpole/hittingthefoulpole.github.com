Anytime a player I hate succeeds, I get pretty upset.  When Jesse Crain throws 2 scoreless innings in a game that has already been decided, I seethe. When Matt Tolbert (and to a lesser extent, Punto)  hits a homer in a blowout victory, I want to throw a remote through my television.  Why? Because it gives them one more chance.  People like Tolbert and Crain make a career out of a string of "one more chances".  If Crain pitches well in a blowout, Gardy will give him a shot the next day in a close game.  If he screws up, well, it's back to garbage time.  When he succeeds there, Gardy says "Wow, he looks good.  Let's give him a shot in a high leverage situation"  It's like the baseball version of cycle of poverty, except since it is baseball it matters more.

If the game is on the line, I don't care who gets the big hit, or who pitches the scoreless innings out of the bullpen. In blowout games though, is it so much to ask that Jesse Crain gets lit up, or that Tolbert makes two errors and strikes out looking on 3 pitches?  Now, I know what you're saying.  "How can it be a close game if our secondbaseman is playing like shit?" Well, humor me and let's say it can happen.

Am I the only one who gets a little upset when these worthless fringe major leaguers play well?

Who else do you hate to see succeed? Doesn't have to be a Twins player.
