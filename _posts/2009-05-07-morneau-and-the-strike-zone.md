I could talk about last night's disaster. I could talk about how Slowey looked terrible, couldn't locate any of his pitches, and was effectively throwing batting practice. I could talk about how that game probably should have been called due to rain, but they inexplicably started it up again to try to speed through the fifth and make it official (it worked).

But I won't. Those things are just daily trivialities, and I know nobody's happy with the way the team is looking right now.

What I <em>am</em> going to talk about is Justin Morneau. Yeah, sure, he's hitting well and his numbers are big and pretty, which kind of negates my theory that his eyes aren't quite back yet. Except ... let's go ahead and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/what-we-learned-in-week-four/">get some numbers from Dave Cameron</a>:
<blockquote><em>Justin Morneau will not wait for you to throw him a strike</em>.

Morneau is a very good hitter in the midst of another very good year. He’s the classic left-handed power hitter, driving in runs in bunches in the middle of the order. He’s the kind of hitter that pitchers don’t want to make a mistake to, and are usually willing to put on first base with a base on balls. Only, Morneau won’t let them. He’s drawn just seven walks this year, and it’s not because pitchers are challenging him - he swung at a staggering 51.2% of pitches outside the strike zone last week, the highest mark in the league. His O-Swing% for the season stands at 37.8%, meaning that he’s swinging at nearly two of every five balls that a pitcher throws. I’m not one to critique the work of a guy with a .404 wOBA, but patience is a virtue, Justin.</blockquote>
When Cameron actually has data to back him up, he seems a little less biased.

Look, I know his base numbers are good. Even one level down, his numbers are good. But you're not going to draw that many walks swinging at 50% of the pitches outside of the strike zone. And you're not encouraging pitchers to actually put one over the plate. They're better off nibbling and missing, with the knowledge that Morneau will still swing at it.

Sure, he's good enough that maybe he'll make contact and poke a single to opposite field. It'll keep his batting average up.

But most pitchers will accept an opposite field single from the big slugger, if it means not having to risk putting a fastball over the plate and possibly getting burned.

I don't know if Morneau's strike zone control problems are related to his vision, or if he's trying to do too much, or if he's just decided he doesn't want to be in the batter's box too long, or what. But as long as he's flailing at the ball like Delmon Young, his Morneau-like stats are not sustainable.
