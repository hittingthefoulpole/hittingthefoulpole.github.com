Danny Haren was <a href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/top-posts/dan-haren-reportedly-traded-to-angels-for-joe-saunders-and-three-other-players.php">traded</a>to the Angels last night for a pretty underwhelming package of Joe Saunders, Patrick Corbin, Rafael Rodriguez and Tyler Skaggs (Skaggs was announced this morning, he was originally a PTBNL).   This probably leaves many Twins fans angry that Smith didn't make a better push (or a push at all) to acquire Haren.  While he hasn't been very good since the first half of 09, he is still a frontline starter.  John Bonnes at <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/TwinsCentric.html">TwinsCentric wrote </a>why he thinks Haren's contract isn't as reasonable as everyone seems to think.  I tend to agree with him, but since Haren is under contract until 2013 we could have used him this year and traded him in the offseason for a pretty decent return (especially if he had a strong august and september).  One of the reasons I read for the DBacks trading him for so little, is they were afraid he wasn't going to rebound to his 07-09 form.  Much like the Rays had to do with Scott Kazmir.  Turns out the rays were right about Kazmir, but I don't think the DBacks will be write about Haren.  He is 29, and doesn't have an injury history like Kazmir does. 

Hopefully this doesn't mean the Twins will just go out and sign Jarrod Washburn, since he sucks and we already have one crappy pitcher whose name ends in -burn.  Why do we need another?  Ted Lilly is still available, and I expect the Twins to pursue him pretty aggressively, only to not get him.  Not that I want him.  I also hope that Smith doesn't assume the rotation problem is fixed because of one non-terrible trip through it.  Yes, everyone has pitched well in their most recent start, but that doesn't mean we can expect Baker and Slowey to be consistently good down the stretch. 

Who else is out there that you would like to see the Twins go after?  Are you as deathly afraid of Lilly as I am?
