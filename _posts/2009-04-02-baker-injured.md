Reader MarkW alerted me to this in the comments, and <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/04/02/baker-placed-on-disabled-list-liriano-to-start-opening-night/">Joe C confirms</a>: Baker is headed to the DL and won't make his Opening Day start.

His apparent injury is "right shoulder stiffness," which sounds like it could either be bad or nothing. The immediate fear here is that he's following in Crain's footsteps and getting injured for a year immediately after signing a long term contract. That kind of thing infuriates me.

But the other possibility is that they just don't think he's ready for the season (he has a 6.85 ERA this spring), and are giving him a little extra time to get ready down in Ft Myers. More like the Nathan/WBC situation than the Crain/Contract situation.

Of course, ultimately "shoulder stiffness" doesn't mean anything, and we're going to have to wait for more information to come out. As MarkW pointed out, we can only hope that this isn't like the Bonser situation where "soreness" rapidly became "season ending surgery" with nothing in between.

Since Baker hasn't pitched (in an actual exhibition game) since March 27, he's eligible to come off the DL on April 12, so he'll miss a minimum of about a week of the season. 1-2 starts. But he did pitch in a AAA game yesterday, and threw 5 scoreless innings. There is no indication at this time that he hurt himself during that start, though he only threw 58 pitches. (It is also not explained why he was pitching in a AAA game. My assumption is that they knew he was injured ... but then why have him pitch at all. Or that they knew he wasn't ready and wanted to backdate his DL stay.)

Stay tuned for more information, folks.
