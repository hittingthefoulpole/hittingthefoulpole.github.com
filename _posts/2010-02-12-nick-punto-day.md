So apparently today is Nick Punto day in the Twins blogosphere.  As most of you know, I am not a fan of Lil' Nicky Punto.  Mainly because I don't like baseball players who aren't good at baseball. Actually that's the only reason I don't like him.  So here is my rambling rant, that is bound to piss people off because they like Punto for some idiotic reason.

I'm sure Punto is a very nice guy, but why in the hell does everyone love him so much? He tries hard. So what.  So do a lot of people.  It doesn't mean we should cheer for them  This isn't little league where everyone gets a trophy.  He is an adequate defender at 3 infield positions.  So what? It doesn't mean I should be cheering for him. I think the biggest problem is Gardy's inability to gauge his actual value. Which is that of a utility infielder.  Not a starter on a contender.

So is this Nick Punto obsession based in his halfway decent 2006 season (which wasn't really all that good when you factor in he was playing third base) where he was one of the sparkplugs to a team that won the division on the last day of the season? If it is that is BS.  Not only has be done very little to help the team since then, I would argue that he has had two seasons that really hurt the team.  Everyone has bemoaned our general badness at the infield positions lately.  If we simple had league average, or even replacement level production instead of the stinkers Punto put up in 07 and 09 who knows what might have happened.  He was a complete black hole offensively, a free out if you will.  There is no level of defense that would make Puno 07 or Punto 09 an acceptable major leaguer.  I understand the importance of defense, but I also understand that it is half the game. 

So can someone  explain to me why people love Punto so much?  Are there several no talent players who try hard that have a irrational fanbase?  Overall I think he is a useful player to have on the team, shouldn't be starting nor should he be making 4 million dollars a year.  I also don't get why we have him AND Tolbert.  Seems like overkill.
