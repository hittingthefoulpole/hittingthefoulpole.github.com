Apparently, the Indians have gone ahead and signed Tyner.Â  Gardy had an interesting reaction.
<blockquote>"They must've been one home run shy of their quota." <em>-- Gardenhire, when asked about former Twin Jason Tyner signing with the Indians</em></blockquote>
This is the sound of me falling off my chair, laughing. It seems to me that teams usually like to get players from a division rival in order to glean information about the team that isn't necessarily apparent from watching film.

The White Sox immediately got better at competing with the Twins when they got their grubby mitts on AJ. Maybe he made a bigger difference because 1) he was good, and 2) he was a catcher. But Tyner was one of Gardenhire's boyfriends, and spent plenty of time on the bench with Gardy, presumably learning all the secrets with the ultimate plan of selling them on the AL Central black market. He surely knew it was his only chance to score another contract.

My only hope is that Gardy knows so little about what he's doing that Tyner's nefarious knowledge won't help our rivals. It's a good thing he's so blase about the possibility though.

And no, I don't think I'm overreacting. Thanks for asking.
