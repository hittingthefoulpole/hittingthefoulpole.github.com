I don't like talking about steroids any more than the next guy, but there's a certain climate right now, regarding performance enhancing drugs. You really want to keep them at arm's length. This wouldn't be the best time to, say, get yourself linked to an absurdly sketchy drug. Right?

Someone needs to tell Delmon that now is <em>not</em> the best time for this. And what the hell is Quercetin?

And ... wouldn't this mysterious drug company want to connect themselves to a player who could, you know, hit or run?
