Albert Pujols has set a deadline of noon (eastern) today for the Cards to reach a deal with his agent. If they don't come up with something, all contract talks will be (allegedly) tabled until the offseason.

The Twins were in a somewhat similar situation with Joe Mauer last year.  Mauer was entering the last season of his contract, and would have been able to name his price on the open market.  I was torn at the time.  I didn't want the Twins to overextend themselves, and hamper their ability to remain competitive for the duration of the contract. What if Joe got hurt and couldn't catch anymore? He was earning a mega-contract based on the fact that he was not only an excellent hitter, but a great catcher.  That double threat doesn't come along very often.  At the catcher position you usually sacrifice one or the other. Well, last spring Mauer signed an 8 year/184 million dollar contract that runs from 2011 through 2018. That is quite the commitment the Pohlad family made to the hometown hero.

I feel for Cards fans.  They are in a similar tax-bracket as the Twins, so they really can't (or shouldn't) tie up a large portion of their payroll with one player.  They are also playing in a new stadium, and have on the field success over the last few years. The Cards recently committed a ton of money to Matt Holliday, so if they miss out on Pujols I'm sure many will point to that as one of the reasons why.  My theory on the whole thing is the Cards should let him walk if they think his contract (along with the rest of their long term commitments) will hamper them competitively over the life of the deal. After this season both Prince Fielder and Adrian Gonzalez will be free agents.  Now, neither of those guys are Albert Pujols, but they are certainly a nice consolation prize. Pujols had an MVP caliber year last year, and the Cards were beat out by the Reds for the NL central title. Since Pujols joined St. Louis in 2001, he has been worth a grand total of 80.6 wins above replacement. Using fangraphs' fancy new WAR grids we find out that leads all players for that time period.  The next closest is A-Rod, at 71. That's a pretty significant gap. All that tells is that Pujols has been the best player in baseball over his career.  We already knew that though, didn't we? Working in the financial services sector I had to amend the following to all of my outgoing emails "past performance does not guarantee future results". The Cards can't pay Pujols hundreds of millions of dollars based on what he has done over the last ten year, but what they think he is capable of over the next ten.  If they believe he can perform at a high level for the life of the contract that, then by all means give it to him.  However, if they think they will be grossly overpaying an aging former superstar for a good chunk of it, then they might be better off letting him walk. The Cards apparently have some of the smartest fans in baseball, so they should know the game is about teams not players. Will they find the next Albert Pujols? Probably not.  Are they capable of winning without him? I certainly think so. It might be a bitter pill to swallow for Cards fans, but there can and will be life after Albert.
