Huge news, everyone! <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/05/29/punto-lands-on-dl-casilla-recalled/">Take it La Velle</a>:
<blockquote>The Twins placed Nick Punto on the DL after the game. Brendan Harris will take over at short. Alexi Casilla will move in at second. Matt Tolbert will back them up.</blockquote>
During last night's game I was surprised and saddened that Tolbert batted with the game on the line -- wait, not saddened; what's that word? Oh yes, <em>furious</em>.

Matt Tolbert is not a good baseball player. I mean, Gardy and all the guts-loving/talent-hating "baseball people" around the Twins love Tolbert because he's "a baseball player," but the thing is that he lacks any semblance of talent. His skillset is exactly that of Punto, which would be valuable except for:
<ol>
	<li>Tolbert is worse at every single skill</li>
	<li>We already have <em>the real Punto</em></li>
	<li>You don't need multiple average-glove-no-hit-utility-infielders on one team</li>
</ol>
Punto being banged up was the reason Tolbert had to bat last night in the 9th, when both Buscher and Young were sitting on the bench; neither of them can play second base, and Punto couldn't come out to play the field.

What might Gardy have done?
<blockquote>I asked Gardy what would he have done in the eighth if Harris had gotten on and Tolbert had to hit. “I would have done something,” he said. Then he said he might have sent Delmon Young up to pinch hit, then used him in the infield. Wow.</blockquote>
Wow, indeed. You know, Delmon doesn't actually hit that badly for a middle infielder.

Well, hopefully Casilla's got his head straight now and can start contributing. I'm curious as to whether Mauer will contine to bat second now that Gardy's got his "number two hitter" back.

And now that Tolbert has been relegated to his rightful place as a "plays once a week backup" type player and The Tolbert Experience has now ended, we can go ahead and say it:

The Tolbert Experience sucked. He actually made me miss Casilla's mistakes.
