Today Buster Olney went around the league to talk to scouts, etc, and has come back to report <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=4026760&amp;searchName=olney_buster&amp;campaign=rsssrch&amp;source=olney_buster">their thoughts</a>. Shockingly, one of them (an anonymous "AL Official") actually had something to say about a Twins player:
<blockquote>Carlos Gomez of the Twins looks like he's gained a lot of weight in the lower half of his body, to me. He's filling out, physically, and at some point, he's going to get bigger in his chest, too. I wonder if he'll be able to run the same way if he keeps getting bigger.</blockquote>
The impression I got of Gomez hasn't been that he looks all that much bigger*, but I suppose it's possible I just haven't noticed. That said, isn't this a good thing?

The lower half of his body gets bigger -- and he's able to generate more power. The upper half of his body follows -- and he's able to generate more power.

As long as Gomez doesn't get <em>fat</em>, I'd say this is unequivocally a good thing.

<em>* Has anyone else noticed anything? Does he look bigger than he did last year?</em>

I wonder if the scout would have focused on the future possibility of Gomez getting slower if he weren't on the Twins. Perhaps he would have pointed out the potential for increased power.

Speaking of which, here's a little brilliance from an anonymous "AL Talent Evaluator:"
<blockquote>I love the way the White Sox play. Does any other organization have as consistent of an attitude from ownership through the general manager, to the manager and field personnel?</blockquote>
Awesome. After years of the entire White Sox organization, at every level, repeating their new mantra ("We want to be just like the Twins"), this guy takes notice and singles them out as unique. I just ... I just don't know what to say about this.

Other than that I can point out <em>at least one</em> other organization that has as consistent an attitude from ownership through the general manager, to the manager and the field personnel. Does anyone want to guess which organization that might be?
