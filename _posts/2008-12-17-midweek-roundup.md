After using a lot of words in this space to speculate who the Twins will acquire in their efforts to upgrade (whenever I use that word I get that stupid Beyonce DirecTV commercial stuck in my head, damn you television!) the left side of the infield; I've decided to address some other noteworthy items from around baseball.

According to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3772806">ESPN</a> Rafael Furcal is not a Brave after all.  The rumors have been all over the place with this guy.  A few weeks back he was reportedly shopping for houses in the bay area, then we heard <em>The Royals</em> offered him the most money.  So let me get this straight, at one point the two front runners for the top FA shortsopt were the A's and the Royals!? Am I taking crazy pills or what?  Then Atlanta swoops in and as of late Monday/early Tuesday he was a Brave....again.  Now as of the time I am writing this, he isn't officially a Brave, but now the Dodgers have stepped in.  This is pretty crazy. Edn result: <strong>Braves</strong>

In other LA related news, Manny isn't getting the 4 year offers from every pro team on the planet as Scott Boras claimed.  I'm pretty sure he expected 52 contract offers of 4 years, 90 million or some nonsense for his enigmatic client.  Newsflash, Scotty, ain't gonna happen.  One way or another, your guy is going to end up in LA.  Or technically Anaheim, I guess.  Your two usual fall-back teams, (that you can trick into signing your client when the LA/NY/Boston's of the world don't want him) Detroit and Texas, aren't biting.  We all know Manny isn't headed back to beantown, and while I've heard a few members of the Yankee front office are interested, I don't see him going there.  As for the Mets, their owner just lost a ton of money in the Madoff scheme, plus they aren't looking for more outfielders.  That leaves LA.  If the Angels lose out on Tex, they will come knocking.  So really, the Dodgers are the only team that appears to be making Manny a priority.  This gives the team the upper hand.  Everyone knows what they are getting in Manny, he is a lose cannon who can hit the crap out of the ball.  But also drag your team down over the course of 162+ games.  Manny even went as far as to threaten retirement if he didn't get more attention on the free agent market.  He is a child.  Throws a tantrum when the gorwn-ups are "ignoring" him.  Good move Manny, I'm sure everyone wants you as a teammate now.  Here is my offer, the Twins will offer you the exact same contract they offered Casey Blake.  That is all I'm willing to offer you.  If only to metaphorically slap you and Boras in the face.  Didn't Boras call the Dodgers first offer "insulting" or something of the sort.  Next up: Boras instructs Manny to hold his breath until he gets the offer he feels he deserves.  End result: <strong>Dodgers.</strong>

Even thouh he is a  Scott Boras client, the Mark Teixeria saga has been shockingly normal.  Does Boras tailor his negotiation strategy to fit the personality of his clients?  Perhaps.  I really hope Tex goes to the O's or Nats.  Hometown team.  I have a few friends who live in the DC area, and they are excited about being able to go the Nationals Park and see an actual player on the home team.  Not a bunch of suckers.

The AJ Burnett signing seems to be a bad one for the Yankees.  While he could be good next year, and maybe the year after.  You are probably looking at 2.5-3 years of badness at an average of 16.5 a year.  That is unfortunate.  If the Yankees still feel the need to add more pitching, they might go after one of Ben Sheets/ Derek Lowe.  Which makes their entire rotation a house of cards. 

Finally, does anyone think Barry Bonds will have a job this year?  I do not.  At least not with a MLB team.  Maybe he can get a job at Dennys or something, but in this job market, I wouldn't count on it Barry.
