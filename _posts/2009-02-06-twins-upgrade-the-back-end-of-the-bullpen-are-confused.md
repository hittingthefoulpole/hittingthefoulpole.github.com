Just hours after new owner Jim Pohlad assured the writers that <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/02/06/pohald-the-offseason-isnt-over/">the offseason isn't over</a>, and that the Twins were looking at upgrading third base and late inning relief, we receive news that they have indeed "upgraded" their late inning relief options by <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/02/06/pohald-the-offseason-isnt-over/">signing Luis Ayala</a>.

He's guaranteed $1.3M for 2009, with up to $575K in performance bonuses. Last season he had a 4.47 FIP in 75.2 IP, with 5.95 K/9 and 2.85 BB/9. While these secondary numbers are better than his traditional stats -- 2-10 with a 5.75 ERA -- I still don't really understand this signing given that we were allegedly looking at other relief options that are <em>all</em> better than Ayala. Last year he was worth 0.0 wins above replacement, for a grand total of $0.1M in free market value.

In fact, he hasn't been worth more than 0.2 wins over replacement since 2004 with the Expos.

This is the kind of guy you offer a minor league contract and an invitation to spring training; <em>not</em> a guy to whom you guarantee a roster spot and over a million dollars. He's the definition of replacement level, and this signing demonstrates that the Twins either aren't paying attention to the market or have absolutely no idea how to value relievers.

But at least we've added another warm body to an already-crowded back end of the bullpen. That should be worth more than a couple blown games this season.
