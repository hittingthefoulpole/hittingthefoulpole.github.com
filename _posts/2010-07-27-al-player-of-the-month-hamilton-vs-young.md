Delmon Young has been white hot.  But you all know that.  Out west (actually, south) Josh Hamilton of the Rangers has been equally hot.  Literally. Their numbers in July are shockingly close.  Let's take a look:

The only places Delmon has a noticble advantage  are batting average and RBI.  These are from ESPN, so forgive their basic-ness, but I think it's best to use these for any discussion, because I can't see AL sportswriters delving any deeper.  Another factor we have to consider is probably team record during the month of July.  Now, why this would have any bearing on an INDIVIDUAL award is beyond me, but we all now that is how it works.  Surprise! Both teams are 11-11 as of this morning.

While a player of the month award for July couldn't get much less important, I just find it interesting how well, and similar, these two guys have been playing.  Delmon is probably still considered a "bad apple" by many, and Hamilton will probably always been a "feel good story".  So, we'll have to see if one of these two guys (or teams) can distinguish themselves from the other over the next few days.  What does everyone else think?
