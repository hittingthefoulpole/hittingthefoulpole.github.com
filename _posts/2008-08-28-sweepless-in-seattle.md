I'm 100% sure I stole that headline from somewhere, but in my defense I haven't read any of the papers this morning.

That was as close to a must win game as we've had all year.  The white sox were playing a terrible team, so you can't assume they will lose.  Perkins didn't look great, but he was effective and kept us in the ballgame.  We got some great timely hitting late in the game, which is what has carried this team all year. 

As much as I hate to say it, Gardy did a good job managing towards the end of the game. Granted, most of the moves were fairly obvious, but they all worked out. The two pinch hitters and the two pinch runners.  Also, if one of those moves wasn't made and you had Kubel in right in the 8th, that throw doesn't get made, and the game is tied or worse.

The white sox did end up getting pounded, leaving us 1 game back in the AL central (2.5 in the WC) with 28 games to go.  This is an exciting time of year to be a baseball fan. Lets stick it to the A's this weekend.
