Twins 3, Blue Jays 2- 11 innings.

We had a good old fashioned pitchers duel last night.  The second time Perkins has been involved in one this season.  However, the offense didn't  let him down as badly this time.  Both lineups were held in check throughout most of the game.  It was very frsutrating to see the Twins load the bases with no outs in the sixth only to have Cuddyer strike out, and Crede ground into a double play.  Perkins didn't let this get him down, he continued to mow through the Jays lineup until the 8th when he gave up a double to Rios, who eventually scored on a single.  His line was still spectacular.  8 innings, 2 ER, 4 Ks, 1 BB.  Can't ask for much more out of your pitcher, especially when facing the highest scoring team in the AL.

Crede more than made up for the inning ending DP, with a walk off double off of Jesse Carlson.  Our very own Jesse pitched two scoreless to pick up the win. 

This was a great game, however I would like to see the offense stop wasting opportunities like they have all season.  I understand we don't have Joe Mauer, but that doesn't mean scoring no runs after loading the bases with no outs is OK. 

Baker gets the start tonight, with the team moving Duensing to Rochester to make room.  This means we are hanging on to RA Dickey for a while.  I'm OK with this move, Duensing will be inserted into the rotation in AAA which is probably better for him. 

Before the season did anyone think Glen Perkins would be our best starting pitcher after two times through the rotation?  I certainly didn't.
