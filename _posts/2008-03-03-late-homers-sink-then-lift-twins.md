This afternoon the Twins faced the Reds, and Glen Perkins got the start. He gave up one run in his 2 innings, walking two batters.

Daigle and Day were both touched up for multiple runs in their outings; Day's was especially bad, as it came in the eighth inning and surrendered the lead. Humber, Bass, and Gomez had scoreless performances.

The hitting was more suspect than the 8-6 final score suggests. Gomez, Mauer, Morneau, and Young each had only one hit; Lamb went 0-3. The best hitter on the day was Ruiz, who went 2-4 with a HR (in the 9th inning, off a nobody minor leaguer). Worse, Morneau grounded into yet another double play (he hits into at least one every time he's in the lineup). He'll need to figure that out if he's going to bat cleanup.

The Twins were winning 4-3 before Day gave up a 3 run homer to make it 6-4. Ruiz tied it with a 2 run shot in the 9th, and the teams elected to play extra innings. Basak ended the game with a 2 run homer in the bottom of the 10th.

Any time you come back in the late innings of a spring training game, it doesn't mean as much. (By the same token, the Reds came back in the late innings too; I think these two clubs just don't have very deep farm systems right now.) That said, a win is a win, and we're up to 2-3 on the (fake) season.
