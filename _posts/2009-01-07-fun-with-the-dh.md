People have been talking about Manny Ramirez lately. A lot. The latest rumor seems to be 3 years, $63M from the Giants. Given the fact that Burrell went for 2/$16M, and Dunn is still available, that seems really high. Manny's numbers are sure to come down.

Baseball Prospectus had <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=8403">this to say about possible AL suitors</a>:
<blockquote>AL teams with holes at DH or even in left field should be coming in on Ramirez given where the price of relative talent lies. The <span class="teamdef">White Sox</span> list a bit to the right, but they were running <span class="playerdef">DeWayne Wise</span> out there in the postseason, so clearly there's some need for a major league left fielder, and Ramirez could move to DH when <span class="playerdef">Jim Thome</span>'s contract expires after this season. The <span class="teamdef">Indians</span>' inability to get production from the corners hurt them last season, and only Shin-Soo Choo is clearly worthy of playing time. Ramirez would also insure against the continued failure of <span class="playerdef">Travis Hafner</span>. By the way, Hafner's four-year, $57 million extension is just kicking in now, and it's been nearly two years since his last stretch of productivity. He'll be 32 in June.</blockquote>
So ... the White Sox and Indians are the main options? Sure, they're teams willing to try to hit home runs. But if you're going through the AL Central looking for teams that could use a little more production out of their DH, I don't see how you can overlook the Twins.

Here's what we got from the DH slot last season:

.269/.344/.438, 19 HR, 98 R, 94 RBI

This season our DH is Kubel, and here's what he did:

.272/.335/.471, 20 HR, 74 R, 78 RBI

Here's what Manny Ramirez did last season:

.332/.430/.601, 37 HR, 102 R, 121 RBI

And, given Manny's price and problems ... here's Adam Dunn:

.236/.383/.513, 40 HR, 79 R, 100 RBI

Kubel, obviously, is the cheapest option. And while Dunn stands to be fairly inexpensive (given Burrell's contract with the Rays), I don't know if the marginal gains over fellow-lefty Kubel justify the massive cost bump. Ramirez might actually be worth the money for us -- can you imagine him hitting between Mauer and Morneau? Because I can, and it's awesome.
