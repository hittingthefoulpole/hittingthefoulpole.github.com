See what I did there? Eight is Enough was apparently a tv show at some point in time.

The Twins had eight arbitration eligible players and they signed them today in order to avoid arbitration.  Arbitration is a pretty ugly process, so avoiding it is great. A player basically has to convince a third party why he deserves X dollars, and management has to convince that party why the player doesn't.  Can you imagine how bridges can be burned if Smith is in a room listing the reasons why Liriano sucks.  With Liriano present. Not fun.

So, here are the contracts:

Pavano- 1 year, $7million

Harris- 2 years, $3.2 million, with various plate appearance incentives included.

Liriano- 1 year, $1.6 million

Hardy- 1 year, $5.1 million

Crain- 1 year, $2 million (that is terrible, by the way)

Guerrier- 1 year, $3.15 million

Young- 1 year, $2.6 million, with various plate appearance incentives.  Should be interesting to see if Gardy benches him down the stretch.  Although the incentives aren't very significant.

Neshek- 1 year $625K. With a minor incentive  that can kick it up to $700K.

Today was a pretty expensive day for the Twins. I don't like the 2 million they gave to Crain, I think we would have been better off non-tendering him.  That figure for Guerrier seems a little high.  Especially when we are paying Nathan a boatload of money, you combine that with Crain and that is one pricey bullpen.

I thought Liriano would make a little bit more, but given his crappy year in 2009 I guess I'm OK with throwing him a million and some change in what might be one of his last chances with the team.  If he ends up in the pen, that makes it that much more expensive and upsets me even more.

I don't really have a problem with giving Harris two years.  He is a useful player who will still be making much less than Nick Punto.

What does everyone else think of the (relatively) big bucks tossed around by the Twins this afternoon? Was it worth it to avoid several ugly arbitration cases? Or would you have like to see Smith take that worthless Canadian Crain down a peg or two?
