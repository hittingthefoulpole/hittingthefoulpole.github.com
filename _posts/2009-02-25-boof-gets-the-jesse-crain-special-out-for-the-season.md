Well it turns out that <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/02/25/bonsers-injury-was-worse-than-expected-season-likely-over/">Boof's injury was a lot worse than anyone expected</a>. His exploratory surgery today revealed a torn labrum and a torn rotator cuff. In other words, he's got The Jesse Crain Special. (So much for Rick Anderson doing such a great job of keeping the players' arms from falling off, by the way.)

These injuries somehow evaded detection on multiple MRIs on multiple different machines, each of which was examined by multiple teams of doctors. So I'm going to go ahead and skip the part where we complain about the Twins' (and Rays') doctors all missing this one three months ago.

This was yet another case where the Twins tried to go the "rest and rehab" route with one of their pitchers, like they do every time. And just like every other time, it didn't work out and surgery ended up being necessary in the first place. And just like every other time it took 3+ months to figure it out, which means instead of being ready to throw in time to get 6+ months in ahead of the season in which he'll actually be returning, Boof's arm will be ready in time to start getting ready for spring training.

As a result, Bonser/Neshek 2010 will be the same as Liriano/Crain 2008. (Except Liriano is better than Bonser and Neshek is better than Crain.)

It's a good thing the Twins are learning their lesson.

But this does mean we can stick Boof on the 60 day DL and keep him on the team for another year without losing him on waivers. Although that seems to be mattering less and less with this guy.
