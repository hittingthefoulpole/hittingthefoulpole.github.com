No, this isn't a post about random Joe Mauer sightings around Minneapolis, it is regarding the Twins to <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091124&amp;content_id=7713508&amp;vkey=news_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min">50th aniversary campaign</a>.  Seems like a cool idea, very similar the the Peanuts campaign in Saint Paul a few years back.

I don't think the Twins need any extra advertising, especially with Target Field opening up, but it can't hurt. I think they should roll it out sooner, especially the statues from the Twins early years, so younger fans can take in a lot of Twins history before the 2010 season starts.  Or they can just use wikipedia, whatever works.
