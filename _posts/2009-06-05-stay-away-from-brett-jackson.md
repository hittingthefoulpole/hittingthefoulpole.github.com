I normally don't like to deal in the rumor trade, but friend of FG.com <a href="http://www.twins-territory.com/2009/june-2009/source-twins-like-brett-jackson.html">Twins Territory has posted a report</a> saying that, apparently, the Twins have their eyes on a college outfielder by the name of Brett Jackson.

Apparently the Yankees and Giants also like him, and he has 20/10 vision. Sounds good, right?

Well, look at this picture:

<img class="aligncenter" title="Brett Jacksons Off Balance Swing" src="http://www.twins-territory.com/images/stories/brett_jackson.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="413" />

Look at his body. Note that a good hitter has his head directly above his ass throughout his swing.

Intelligent reader Thrylos recently pointed out that a balance problem <em>exactly</em> like this one could very well be the problem with Delmon Young.

Oh, and another thing! If his vision is so good ... what's he doing swinging at that pitch? Is his unwillingness to take a bad pitch the reason for the Twins' interest, or is it his lack of a power stroke?

This is me hoping some other team makes a mistake on drafting Jackson. The Yankees or Giants may be able to fix his swing; I know for a fact that the Twins won't be able to.
