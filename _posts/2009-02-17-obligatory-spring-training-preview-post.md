Well, we have spent most of the offseason debating who will start where, who will make the team, etc. So this preview seems a little unnecessary, but with the addition of Ayala, and the excitement of baseball in the air, lets do it. 

As everyone knows, pretty much 22 of 25 roster spots are locked.  Barring injury or freak under-performance the only battles will be for the two remaining bullpen spots, and the 4th bench spot.

Pitcher locks: Baker, Liriano, Slowey, Blackburn, Perkins, Breslow, Guerrier, Ayala, Crain, Nathan (10).  This leaves two spots up for grabs.  The guys fighting for the last two spots will be: Bonser, Humber, Mijraes, Korecky.  If the Twins hadn't signed Ayala, I would say Mijares would be a lock.  Bonser's recent shoulder trouble could complicate matters, but my guess is Boof and Humber make the team with Mijares being on the first flight out at the first sign of trouble. 

Position Player Locks: Mauer, Redmond, Morneau, Casilla, Punto, Buscher, Harris, Cuddyer, Span, Young, Kubel, and Gomez.  (12).  That leaves one bench spot up for grabs.  The favorite here has to be Matt Tolbert.  He endeared himself to Twins fans and Gardy last year by trying really hard.  He is valuable in that he can play many positions in the infield, which is great when we have 12 pitchers and a third base platoon.  Harris will be able to backup at several other spots too. 

So there you have it.  Barring anything out of the ordinary, there are three roster spots up for grabs.  We have two young pitchers who are out of options and might make the team because of that.   I think they should both be given a shot, since I hate trading away pitching sight unseen.  However, if we can get something good in return for one of them, do it. 

Notice how I didn't mention Joe Crede?  If we do end up with him, I could see Buscher moving into the "fighting with Tolbert for a spot" category.  Since Harris is more valuable than Buscher as a bench player.  Thats all you get on Crede.   Does anyone have a drastically different take on this?  Or is this pretty much how everyone thinks things will pan out?
