As many of you know, the Twins and White Sox start a pretty important series tonight at the dome.  The match-ups have been set.  Its Vazquez-Baker tonight, followed by Buehrle-Blackburn tomorrow night, and Floyd-Slowey is the matchup for the finale on wednesday night.  Some people say that all three games are must wins for the Twins. I agree with these people.  We have won something like 5 of our last 6 home games against Chicago, a trend that needs to continue.  

If we sweep the series we are a half game up, if we only win two of three we are 1.5 games back.  The Sox still have that make-up game to play with the Tigers due to the rainout a few weeks back. This will only be played if necessary.  We play KC at home after the White Sox, and the Sox go back to Chicago to play the Indians.  

Thoughts on the series? Does anyone think the Twins can afford to lose one of these games?
