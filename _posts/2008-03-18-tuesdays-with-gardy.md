Liriano has looked very Livan-esque in his handful of starts so far. I do not think this should be a huge concern.  Everyone knew it would take time, and three spring starts isn't enough to get him back into shape.  Apparently his slider showed more bite yesterday, but his velocity was down.  I am worried however, that the front office people claim Rochester is not an option.  Why?  Wouldn't it be better if he was starting in triple A, working on his arm strength, than in the Majors working in long relief.  Although, with the rotation it looks like the twins will trot out in two weeks (some combo of Livan, Baker, Bonser, Slowey, Blackburn and Humber) long relievers might get a fair amount of work in.  Even more if Baker's back problems/flu persist.  Sidenote: Is everyone on the team deathly ill now?  It seems as though the stomach flu or something is going arond.  Isn't it hard to get the flu and the common cold while in florida, isn't that why old people move there? I'm not a doctor, but it seems strange.  Although I guess with all the time these guys spend together in very close quarters, if one person is sick, everyone is sick.

Also, it seems as if very few people have mentioned how well Bonser has actually pitched so far this spring.  His change-up has been impressive, and he plans to use it more this season.  It seems like everyone just wants to talk about how much weight he has lost. We got it, he is skinny (relatively) and we all know why. He exercised and ate well, no secret there. Lets move on and talk about baseball not miracle diets.

 Gardy actually made a statement that I 100% agree with.  He said Casilla might be better off being the Twins SS of the future.  At short his great range and arm are more useful than at second.  As <a href="http://www.aarongleeman.com">Gleeman</a>pointed out today, Gardy could fall in love with Adam Everett if he exhibits the all glove, no bat style of play that Gardy seems to favor over all glove, all bat.  This move will also help considering the lack of major league ready shortstops in the Twins system.  I think we can erase 2007 from Casilla's stat sheet because the way Gardy jerked him around seemed to really mess with him.  Hopefully he has grown up since then and can roll with the punches a little better.
