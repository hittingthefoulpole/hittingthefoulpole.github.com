Joe Mauer's 8 year, $184M extension was the crowning achievement of Bill Smith's excellent offseason last winter. It was the fourth-largest contract ever bestowed upon a baseball player, but it was more than that. It was the hometown hero getting locked up through his prime and into his twilight years. It was the golden boy making good. It was validation of every schoolboy's dream, that he can one day star for his favorite team. It was a symbol of the Twins emerging from the mid-market doldrums, announcing that they can compete with the big boys dollar-for-dollar, and actually hang onto their players once they become expensive stars.

This week, Mauer won his third Gold Glove and his fourth Silver Slugger. When you're voted the best hitter _and_ fielder at your position, well, let's just say that puts you in the upper echelon of the league. Elite, if you will. So, why have I been getting this feeling, lately, that the Twins are going to come to _really_ regret this contract?

Maybe it's the fact that the Twins locked him up after his otherworldly 2009 season, when he hit .365/.444/.587, leading the league in all categories to win the "Modern Triple Crown." I'm not crazy enough to think that he's going to be able to repeat that performance again, ever. But the contract pays him as if he's going to do that every year until he's 36.

According to Baseball-Reference, Mauer dropped from a 7.9 WAR in 2009* to 5.6 in 2010. By Fangraphs' estimation, he dropped from an 8.0 WAR in 2009 to 5.1 in 2010. Was 2010 the outlier, or was 2009?

_* Strangely, Baseball-Reference pegged Mauer at 8.7 WAR in 2008, when he his .328/.413/.451 ... rating the season in which he posted a 134 OPS+ as nearly a full win better than the one he posted a league-leading 170 OPS+. Fangraphs had him at 5.7 WAR that same year. I like WAR as a statistic, but they're going to have to iron this sort of thing out. That's a massive gap, no?_

Well, Mauer's Fangraphs WAR by season: 1.2, 3.5, 5.9, 3.2, 5.7, 8.0, 5.1. His Baseball-Reference WAR by season: 1.5, 3.4, 7.0, 4.6, 8.7, 7.9, 5.6.

The way Fangraphs puts it, Mauer's 2009 is a massive outlier, the one time in seven years that he bested even 6 WAR. Baseball-Reference is more generous, saying he was better than 7 WAR in three of seven seasons. I don't know which one is "right," but the fact that they disagree so heavily doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.

If Mauer can continue to post a 7+ WAR season almost 50% of the time, he'll be worth that contract -- as long as the Twins are competitive the entire time. But if he's only going to be a 5 WAR player, as Fangraphs indicates, then he's already significantly overpaid, and the situation will only get worse as he ages and inevitably declines. And he wouldn't be worth anywhere close to this kind of money if he [weren't a top defensive catcher](http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101111&content_id=16073258&vkey=news_min&c_id=min).

> "There will be a point where I'm not going to be able to play there anymore," said Mauer of his catching responsibilities, during a conference call to talk about his Gold Glove award. "But I hope I don't have to worry about this for a long time."

A typically diplomatic response from the staid Mauer, and maybe the question shouldn't even have been asked of him while he was celebrating a third consecutive Gold Glove. But everybody knows Gold Gloves are often undeserved. (I'm sure everyone reading this noticed that Mauer didn't exactly look like his awesome self of old behind the plate this year. This Gold Glove, I think, was won more in the past than in the present.)

Maybe, though, when you sign a contract like this, it's about more than just production on the field. You're signing a Face of your franchise, someone who represents the team, and the organization, and the fanbase. To a certain point, that guy, that Face, what he brings to the table goes beyond simply what he offers on the diamond. [Joe Posnanski talked about this when he wrote about Derek Jeter's contract negotiation with the Yankees](http://joeposnanski.si.com/2010/11/10/the-jeter-question/).

> Everyone here knows how much I love Joe Mauer, but I’m not sure how ready he is for all the stuff that comes with being one of baseball’s biggest stars. I saw him really struggling with the media and his role as face of the franchise after his big contract — and that’s in Minnesota. It’s not anywhere close to as easy as people think.

I wish I could find the old Land o' Lakes commercial featuring Mauer; it seems to have been scrubbed from the internet. For good reason, too, if you're Mauer or his agent, or the Twins, or MLB. That video shows a Joe Mauer who is not ready to represent a baseball team, who cannot handle the role of leader under the bright lights that today's media shines.

In the end, I think that's what has been bugging me. Joe Mauer is an excellent _baseball player_, with all that that entails: times when you're up, and other times when you're down; good years and bad years; victories and defeats. But maybe when the contract is _this big_, well, maybe you're expecting more than just a baseball player. You expect someone superhuman, you expect good years without bad, victories without defeats. And you're not going to get it.

It's time, then, to adjust expectations. Mauer is an excellent baseball player, a guy who can post 5+ WAR seasons, a guy who can give you 130 OPS+ seasons year in and year out; he's not a superhero who can toss out 8 WAR, 170 OPS+ mega-seasons with any regularity. The only thing to do is enjoy it, hope he loosens up a bit in the limelight, hope he stays healthy, and hope his contract doesn't hamstring the Twins in the future.

That seems like a lot of hoping, for 184 million dollars.
