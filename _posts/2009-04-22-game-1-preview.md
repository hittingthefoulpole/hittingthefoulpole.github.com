The Twins and Red Sox will hopefully get at least one of the two scheduled games in today.  The <a href="http://www.accuweather.com/us/ma/boston/02101/city-weather-forecast.asp?partner=accuweather&amp;u=1&amp;traveler=1">weather in Boston</a> is dicey, but it looks like it will be OK for the first game.

We are facing Tim Wakefield, and that got me to thinking about knuckleballs and knuckleballers.  Will the addition of RA Dickey this season perhaps help the Twins hitters in their approach to facing a knuckleball?  Maybe having him around to throw batting practice or something will help.  However, the reason the knuckleball is effective is because of its unpredictability.  A hitter could see a BP knuckler hundreds of times, and it really won't help them in a game situation.  Especially since I'm sure the pitch varies from pitcher to pitcher more than a traditional pitch.

Hopefully the wind isn't too strong in Fenway this afternoon.  I would hate to see Baker break some sort of record for most homers given up in the first two starts.  Because he has to be somewhat close.

The Red Sox bats are starting to wake up, which is another reason to be very nervous about this game.  Hopefully I am wrong and Baker rights this ship with an impressive showing, and the bats tee off on wakefield and his knuckleball.
