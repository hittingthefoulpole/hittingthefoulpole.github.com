The next important task for the Twins is figuring out who will play CF.  As of now it looks like Pridie/Gomez/Span will compete for the job.  Another thought would be to play Monroe there for at least half of of the season so Gomez or Pridie can adjust.  Neither situation is ideal, but the latter could be nice because it would keep Monroe in the lineup.  If he is sitting on the bench he will be burning a hole in Gardy's pocket and I am afraid he would steal ABs from Kubel.  I know he isn't great in CF, but he will be serviceable.

A third option would be to sign Kenny Lofton or Corey Patterson.  My problem with Patterson is he would be almost no different than playing Gomez right now.  Lofton is too old to play center at the level he used to, but still wouldn't be worse than Monroe.  There really isn't a clear cut good choice, the Twins just need to make one and stick with it.  They shouldn't allow Gomez and Pridie platoon at the major league level (or any level for that matter). Make a choice and stick with it. Whether its Monroe, one of the young guys, or a 1 year free agent stop gap.  

Considering the equipment truck is on its way to FL, signing a free agent would have to happen soon.  I know Delmon Young has played a game or two in center and he is a freak athlete so he might be worth a look, but I would prefer we just stick him in left and let him mash the ball.
