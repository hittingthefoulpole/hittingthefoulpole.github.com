In case anyone wants to feel hopeful about Dickey in Chicago tonight, here's <a href="http://tenthinningstretch.blogspot.com/2009/04/cold-weather-and-knuckleballs-ra-dickey.html">an interesting take on knuckleballers in cold weather</a>, from intelligent reader thrylos98:
<blockquote>There is another physical factor that affects a knuckleball more than the wind: Air density. The colder the temperature, the denser the air, the less the spin. And throwing a knuckleball with no spin, is like throwing a brick to the batters.</blockquote>
The game is just starting, and Dickey hasn't taken the mound yet. Hopefully that's exactly how it works tonight.
