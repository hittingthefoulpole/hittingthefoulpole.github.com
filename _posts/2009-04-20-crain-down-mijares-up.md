Jesse Crain has been placed on the DL with shoulder stiffness, <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/">LEN3 reports</a>.  It is apparently minor, and hopefully he will be good to go in about 10 days time.  In the meantime, the Twins have called up Jose Mijares. After an awful spring, he has put together a nice start in Rochester.  He is currently on a 6.1 scoreless innings stretch.  I'm not sure who will slide into the 8th inning role, but the top choices have to be Guerrier or Breslow.  I am not basing that on anything other than those are the two guys Gardy probably trusts the most. Hopefully we see Nathan used a little bit more, but that usually doesn't happen this early in the season.

I like what I have seen out of Morillo, although from the scouting reports it sounds like he will have trouble throwing strikes consistently, so its best if he is used in low leverage situations.    This is a blow to the Twins already weak bullpen.  Hopefully Mijares can step it up and be useful in his (hopefully) short stint in the majors. 

The list of people I don't trust out of the bullpen has grown to include the following:

Ayala, Dickey, Morillo, Mijares, Guerrier, Breslow.  So everyone but Nathan is what I'm trying to say.
