Joe Nathan has made it clear he would like to sign in the neighborhood of a 5 year deal and "doesn't have to push his salary limits". Does that mean he will play for below market value?  That is great, but do we need a high priced closer when we will be playing very meaningful games?  I think Neshek, or to a lesser extent Crain and Rincon could be just as effective on a .500 team as Nathan.  Depending on the deal, both its dollar value and length, I could be convinced to keep him.  It does feel good to have Nathan warming up to pitch the ninth.  I remember the days when we had LaTrine Hawkins and "Everyday except for weekends and major holidays" Eddie.  That made for some long, nerve racking ninth innings.  I don't want to go back to that.

On an unrelated note I read an interesting fact in the paper this morning.  The Giants won the Super Bowl in both January of 1987 and January of 1991. The Twins won World Series titles in October of both of those years. And if I recall, in 1991 we were coming off a down year. I'm just sayin'.......
