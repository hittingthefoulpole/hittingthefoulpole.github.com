Well opening day is finally here.  I never thought I'd say this, but God bless the Metrodome. We are supposed to get several inches of snow in Minnesota today, which is not cool.  Anyway, today's pitching matchup is Livan Hernandez (RHP) vs. Jared Weaver (RHP).  The big question today is will Gardy be smart and start Kubel at DH against the right handed Weaver, or will he be dumb and start Monroe. My money is on Monroe, hopefully I'm wrong.  Feel free to toss out predictions.  I think Livan will give up a homer to Hunter, and maybe Vlad, too.  However, since he was signed to be an innings eater, he will pitch 5 innings or more.  Regardless of how many runs he gives up Gardy won't yank him, especially this early in the season.  This will cause us to get frustrated (read: drink lots of beers).

It sounds like Liriano will make one start at class A Ft. Myers, and then another 5 days later for Rochester, and the plan is to have him stretched out to 100 pitches by then and then call him up for the third time through the rotation.  My guess is Blackburn will then be sent to Rochester, but hopefully Livan has an ERA north of 11 after two starts and Gardy has to get rid of him.  This will not happen and we will continue to develop a problem drinking habit over the course of the season.  How about some predictions.
