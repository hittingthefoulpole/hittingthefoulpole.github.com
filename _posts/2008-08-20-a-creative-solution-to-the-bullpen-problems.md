The recent problems with the Twins' bullpen have been well documented, and we have our own opinions about what should be done about it. Apparently, though, <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2008/08/20/casilla-activated-bass-outrighted-to-rochester/">the Twins have different ideas</a>.

What's the solution to an overworked bullpen?

A smaller bullpen!

That's right. In order to make room for Casilla, the Twins passed over the obvious move (DL/DFA Everett) and chose another much-needed move -- Brian Bass has been outrighted to Rochester. (Shockingly, he cleared waivers!)

What this means is that we'll be going with an 11 man pitching staff for a while -- and that the starters are going to need to pick up their game and start getting deeper into games, and that the offense is going to have to start scoring and giving us more blowouts.

Now, perhaps this is just step one, the second step being: DL/DFA Everett and call up Korecky (this would have to happen before 8/31, because I can't imagine the Twins plan to set their playoff roster with an undermanned bullpen). And Gardy did say that another pitcher is "just a phone call away."

But the fact that Gardy took the time to point out how well Randy Ruiz has been swinging the bat sends an ominous message. We're not going to get bullpen help until/unless Ruiz stops hitting, and we're going to have to live through more Adam Everett and the Amazing Shrinking Arm (and Bat, and Glove ... Ouch).

I don't know. Part of me is happy -- no more Brian Bass. Another part of me is confused -- I thought we had an overworked bullpen ... this doesn't seem to solve that. We'll see how this works out.
