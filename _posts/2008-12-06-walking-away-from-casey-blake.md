Great news!

As you're no doubt aware, the Twins have been in talks with Casey Blake to sign the elderly third baseman to a multi-year deal, one that would make him the new largest free agent signing in franchise history. The Twins wanted to go two years with an option; Blake wanted three years guaranteed. This was, apparently, the only point of difference, and the Twins have now broken off the talks.

Blake would have been an expensive non-upgrade, and guaranteeing him a third year would have been foolhardy. It's good to see the Twins sticking to their guns here, and not caving to the demands of Blake's agent. Too often, teams look at their list of needs and allow themselves to be held hostage by agents who think they set the prices -- the teams set the prices.

Also, I'm really annoyed by players who want more guaranteed years, and won't even take an option year with a buyout clause. If Blake were actually planning to be playing well in three years, then the option doesn't matter at all; either the Twins take it and he gets the money, or they give him his buyout and he signs somewhere else and makes more money. Demanding the guarantees on the backend of the contract means the player doesn't expect to be worth another contract by then -- they're basically telling you they're trying to swindle you. Don't do it.

I think the Twins have the right philosophy when it comes to these free agents. Torii Hunter knew he wouldn't be worth the money in the fourth and fifth years of that contract, which is why he wouldn't negotiate with the Twins, who also knew that. Casey Blake knows it too, which is why the Twins are walking away.

La Velle goes over most of the rest of our <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2008/12/06/twins-break-off-talks-with-casey-blake/">options for the left side of the infield</a>; the list of options is shrinking as teams make deals and shortstops find their new homes. The price in trade for guys like Beltre, Atkins, and Hardy are sure to rise from their already inflated levels. I can't see the Twins parting with Slowey and Span for anyone, especially not one of those guys. It seems to me that it's increasingly likely that the Twins don't make any moves this offseason. At least not significant moves.

And an update on Delmon?
<blockquote>Delmon Young as part of a package? There have been rumblings that the Twins have shopped him around, but I was told yesterday and this morning that’s not true. Yes, the Twins have fielded calls about Young. But they aren’t giving him away. They like the possibility of having great outfield depth next season. And, I was told, they haven’t forgotten what happened when they gave up on David Ortiz.</blockquote>
You mean the Twins are actually capable of learning a lesson from the mistakes they made in the past? I've been drawing the connection between DOrtiz and Kubel for a while; it's just as applicable with Delmon. It's great to hear that the Twins plan to give Delmon more time, and that they appreciate the value of outfield depth. I'm well aware that these "rumblings" aren't coming from Gardy, but from the front office.

I guess I'm just glad Gardy doesn't have any say.
