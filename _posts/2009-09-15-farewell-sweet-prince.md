Well, <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/09/14/twins-get-bad-news-on-morneau-rally-anyway/">Morneau is out for the rest of the year</a>.  He has a stress fracture in his back, which was revealed by a CT scan yesterday.  That certainly is a bummer, but hopefully we can rally and end the season on a positive note by winning some games for Mr. Morneau.

5.5 back, 7 left to play against Detroit, their magic number is 14. Lets stay focused. Go Twins.
