Well, the mystery of the Disappearing Bullpen Help may have been solved. As recently discussed in the comments over on our last post, Gardenhire claims that he's looking for a spot to put Mijares into a game, but <em><a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2008/09/11/twins-royals-getaway-day/">can't find one</a></em>.
<blockquote>Twins manager Ron Gardenhire is trying to find a spot to get a look at lefthander Jose Mijares. The ninth inning last night seemed to be a good time,  but the manager - with memories of several blown leads this season fresh in his mind - didn’t want a situation where Mijares gave up a couple runs and force him to warm up Joe Nathan. “Six runs is not that big of a lead in this league,” he said.</blockquote>
Oh, that's right. Six runs ahead just isn't enough of a lead. He might give up a few runs, in which case we'd have to use one of our better relievers who are all overworked. We wouldn't want to do that. Instead, we'll just use our better relievers who are all overworked. Problem solved!

So. Six runs ahead is too close. Obviously, Mijares and Humber aren't coming into a game closer than that. That leaves the only possibility of these young relievers getting any work is if we're being blown out. And if we're losing by a lot, it stands to reason that we wouldn't want to prevent the other team from scoring -- oh no, we wouldn't want to attempt a comeback and actually try to win a game! It's much more important to just give up and prepare for the next day!

I can understand why Gardy would only want to bring these guys in in a blowout. That's fine. (At first, until they demonstrate what they can do against big league hitters.) But ... I don't understand why we have to be <em>losing</em> <em>big</em> in order to see what they've got. Are we afraid he'll give up the rare Grand-Slam-and-a-Half?
