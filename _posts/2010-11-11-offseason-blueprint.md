You know what was in vogue last week? Offseason blueprints! That's why we're finally getting around to one here at Hitting the Foul Pole, where you can always trust that we'll wait until something has gone slightly stale before taking a bite.

Many of the blueprints I've glanced at -- I haven't read all of them, mind you -- seem to assume that the Twins will be just as active this offseason as they were last winter. But last year, the Twins were reaping the rewards of entering the new stadium, and thus had a lot more money than usual to spend. Now that they're at (or above) their payroll limit, I'd guess that they'll be back to their normal behavior of looking to get adequate players on the cheap to replace the production of more expensive players.

## Position Players

- C: Joe Mauer
- 1B: Justin Morneau
- 2B: Alexi Casilla
- 3B: Danny Valencia
- SS: JJ Hardy
- LF: Delmon Young
- CF: Denard Span
- RF: Michael Cuddyer
- DH: Jim Thome

I expect that the Twins will make an offer to Nick Punto, something along the lines of 2 years, $5M. I also expect, though, that someone else will find his particular skillset more valuable than that -- he is more valuable than that, especially to a team in the Twins' predicament, talent-wise. However, with the budget crunch, that money is better spent elsewhere. I think Punto's days with the Twins are probably over, and I'll have to make sure I write about that when it happens.

I also think it'd be a good idea to re-sign Jim Thome. The fans love him, the players love him; he seemed to have a good influence on the slower, stronger players on the team. He's said he'd love to come back, and Bill Smith has said the Twins would love to have him back. They'll find a way to make it work, probably in the $3-5M range.

JJ Hardy has been called a "non-tender candidate" by a lot of people -- and it's true that his production was disappointing in 2010 -- but I just don't see it. Even while he struggled, he was among the best shortstops in the American League. The only real gamble here is whether he'll be able to stay healthy; he probably won't, which means we'll see plenty of Trevor Plouffe in 2011.

Casilla can slide in and replace most of Orlando Hudson's production for 10% of the price -- but, as is always the case with Casilla, just because he _can_ doesn't mean he _will_. Will we see the Casilla who posts a 95 OPS+ and makes dazzling plays, or the Casilla who posts a 45 OPS+ and botches routine plays? Nobody knows ... and this could be Casilla's last shot with the Twins. If he sucks this year, he could be gone.

I know a lot of people want to see Cuddyer gone. But his salary means that the Twins wouldn't get anything in a trade for him unless they ate most (or all) of his salary, and his good-but-not-great talent level means that even then, they wouldn't get much. Not to mention, by the way, that there's nobody who can really slide in and replace him. This will be Cuddyer's last season with the Twins, as Joe Benson and Aaron Hicks may move quickly through the system this year. But there's no feasible way -- or reason -- to get Cuddyer off the roster for 2011. (That said, I hate the fact that the Twins had to decide on his 2011 option before the 2010 season. If they had to decide on his option _now_, they could easily decline it and sign him to a smaller salary, and he'd take it.)

## Bench

- C: Jose Morales
- IF: Matt Tolbert
- OF: Jason Kubel
- OF: Jason Repko

I hate Drew Butera, and Morales seems like the ideal backup catcher. I know that Butera will get the call in Morales' stead, but I don't care for it. Not even a little bit.

Tolbert is like the poor man's Punto. He's worse at every defensive position, he's even worse at the plate, and he hustles even more falsely. But he's a utility infielder who can fill in at all three infield positions, and every team needs one of those.

Kubel will be able to spell Young, Cuddyer, and Thome, and will get a ton of playing time -- probably more than Thome, actually. It's probably not even fair to put him on the bench. He needs a bounce-back season, and I don't think it's crazy to hope that he finds a happy medium between the "one of the best hitters in the league" of 2009 and the "sucks" of 2010.

Repko can do for the outfield what Tolbert can do for the infield. He can get hot and hit a little bit, but he can also go _ice cold_. But as a right handed batter who can pinch hit for one of the lefties in the lineup, or pinch run for one of the lumbering dinosaurs, or come in as a defensive replacement for anyone in the outfield, he's got value. And a spot on the roster.

I wouldn't be surprised to see Ben Revere called up in the second half of the year; he's not ready now, though.

## Rotation

- Francisco Liriano
- Scott Baker
- Kevin Slowey
- Nick Blackburn
- Brian Duensing

This is probably the spot that most fans want to see the most change, but I don't really see how it's going to happen. The Twins will definitely offer Pavano arbitration; he'll decline and take a multi-year deal elsewhere, because he's the best free agent pitcher not named "Cliff Lee" and has now put together a track record of kicking ass for a contending team. So long and thanks for all the fish; and draft picks.

I was a big pusher for Liriano in 2010 -- and after I made his Cy Young case, he decided to basically call it a season and suck in all the rest of his starts. So that was awesome. That said, he was excellent despite piss-poor luck. I'm guessing his luck will improve while his dominance slides a little bit, and his shallow numbers will look better in 2011 than they did in 2010.

Beyond Liriano, the rotation either looks fairly solid ... or like a total mess. I think it depends on which angle you look at it. Or which side of the bed you woke up on, or the phase of the moon. Something. Baker and Blackburn aren't going anywhere, as they're under contract (and haven't been good enough that some other team would be willing to trade for those contracts).

I think the Twins like Duensing, and they might as well keep riding him. He's not as good as his numbers, but on the other hand he's good enough to be an excellent fifth starter. (Which could get him a bunch of wins this season, making him an intriguing trade chip for next winter.)

There have been stories bouncing around that the Twins have soured on Kevin Slowey; something about not liking his attitude. I don't understand that at all, since he seems like exactly the sort of pitcher the Twins like (tons of strikes, no walks, lots of line drives and home runs), and he sure doesn't seem like an asshole -- not like Garza and Lohse, anyway. So if the Twins are going to make a move in the rotation, I guess it'd be to move Slowey and replace him somehow, but I bet they don't bother.

## Bullpen

- Joe Nathan
- Matt Capps
- Jesse Crain
- Jose Mijares
- Anthony Slama
- Rob Delaney
- Jeff Manship

Nathan will be back! His days of dominance are probably behind him, and he'll be a vastly overpaid figurehead; but you don't have to be awesome to be a Closer. The unholy combination of Jon Rauch and Matt Capps combined to convert just as many saves at the same rate as Joe Nathan At His Best would have. So it'll probably be nice to be able to hide Nathan in the 9th inning, where he can rack up easy saves like he did to earn that fat contract in the first place. It'll be a fun ride, with plenty of white knuckles and broken bottles.

I think Capps is a non-tender candidate, much more than Hardy is, but the Twins aren't even going to consider that. They gave up Wilson Ramos to get him, and part of their reasoning was that Capps was under team control for 2011. So they'll offer him arbitration, he'll make $6-8M, and he'll demonstrate once again that he's really not all that great. Having Capps in the 8th inning is another way to hide Nathan in the 9th -- leads that Nathan could have tried to protect will be pissed away before he has a chance. Brace yourself for a lot of "I hate Matt Capps" tweeting next year.

Mijares is good and cheap; Manship can do the job of a long reliever, and will be capable of sliding into the rotation when someone inevitably sucks (I'm looking at you, Blackburn) or gets injured (Slowey!). Other long relief options include Alex Burnett, Glen Perkins, and the newly acquired Eric Hacker ... all of whom make me want to go stand in the rain for a while.

The rest of the bullpen is tricky, though. The Twins have Jesse Crain, Matt Guerrier, Jon Rauch, Ron Mahay, and Brian Fuentes as pending free agents. Offering arbitration to any of them is dangerous, because they would probably make more money in arbitration than they would on the free agent market, especially those Type A free agents that would cost signing teams a draft pick.

You know what's funny about the draft pick compensation? That the picks are all the same, regardless of the relative talents of the players being signed or how big the contracts are. Carl Crawford and Cliff Lee are Type A free agents, but no team would blink an eye when surrendering a first round draft pick to get them; but a guy like Juan Cruz or Orlando Hudson or Orlando Cabrera can see their market value completely disappear by getting that scarlet A stapled to their chest.

Here's the thing: the surplus value of a draft pick in the second half of the first round is calculated to be [$5.2M, by Victor Wang](http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2009/7/20/950254/which-is-better-compensation). When you're talking about signing a long term contract worth over $100M, that extra $5M you're giving up isn't a big deal. But when you're signing a guy for around $5M (because that's what he's worth), then it's basically crazy that you'd have to give up a first round pick for the right to do so -- it _doubles_ what you have to pay, and gives a long term asset to a rival team.

This is made worse by the fact that the "Type A" system is totally broken: [12 of the 34 Type A free agents are relief pitchers.](http://twitter.com/SamMillerOCR/status/2743781556228096)

The point is this: don't expect the Twins to get a bunch of draft picks in return for their departing relief corps. Guerrier has been used a lot -- I kind of expect his arm to fall off at any moment. Mahay sucks. Rauch sucks. If Fuentes gets an arbitration offer he's guaranteed to take it, since he'll make at least $9M from it.

The only interesting guy is Jesse Crain. He apparently believes he can get a look as a Closer somewhere; the Twins should offer him arbitration and tell him they fully support his search for a 9th inning job somewhere, and that if he doesn't find anything he's welcome to come back to the Twins on a 1-year or 2-year deal.

## Conclusion

As you can see, I don't expect this to be a very active offseason. Everyone on the roster according to this blueprint was on the roster in 2010. Even still, the payroll would be well over $100M.

Bear in mind, this won't be a disaster for Twins fans, and it wouldn't be a failure by the front office. The Twins shot for the moon in 2010, and played three bad games at the wrong time. They can return _most_ of that team for another shot in 2011, before it's time for another 2008/2009-style retooling.

Last winter was exciting, and gave Twins fans a taste of what the hot stove season is like when your team actually participates. Don't get used to it, though -- it's not going to happen every year. So sit back and watch the other teams fight, and wait for Spring Training. It gets closer every day!
