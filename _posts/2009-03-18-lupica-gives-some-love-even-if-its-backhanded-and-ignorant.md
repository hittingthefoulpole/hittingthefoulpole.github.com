On Tuesday the Twins got some rare love from a non-local writer; <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/2009/03/17/2009-03-17_ron_gardenhires_twins_a_wise_investment.html">Mike Lupica of the NY Daily News wrote a standard spring training puff piece</a> on something <em>other</em> than "Why is Derek Jeter So Sexy and Clutch ... and Also What is A-Rod's Deal?!" I believe he's re-used that headline about 8 times in the last three years. The point is, he's venturing a little out of his comfort zone, which is good to see.
<blockquote>An old Met named Ron Gardenhire, a scrub who would eventually become a great baseball manager</blockquote>
This is one of those turns of phrase that describe someone so well. He wasn't much of a player in his day, which is probably the source of his weaknesses as a manager: a soft spot for weak-hitting middle-infield-utility-players, a prejudice against players with natural talent (preferring players who "grind it out" over a long and unsuccessful career, mostly in the minors), etc. But given the Twins' perennial presence at the top of the division leaderboard, there's no doubting Gardy's prowess as a manager. (Although I'd say "great" <em>might</em> be pushing it. Until we win a World Series or two.)
<blockquote>Gardenhire was talking about his division, the Central, and talking about how the Indians have reloaded and how he still doesn't know how anybody ever gets through the Tigers' batting order and when you ask him about his own team he says, "If we stay healthy, we're going to be there."</blockquote>
On paper, sure, the Tigers have a strong lineup. But the thing is that too many people make the mistake of seeing names rather than players. And the Tigers are <em>old</em>. And beyond that, is it <em>possible</em> that Miguel Cabrera is over the hill? (They paid him huge money because he hit like a DH but played 3B ... and then discovered he was so awful at 3B they had to move him to 1B ... and then he went back to hitting like a 3B. If I were in Detroit, I'd be pissed about that contract. Look at it this way: Is Miguel Cabrera <em>twice</em> as valuable as Justin Morneau? What if you didn't know their names and just looked at their numbers?)

And he's right about the Indians, of course. Because they're just like the Twins, except their farm system is built hitting-first vs the Twins' pitching-first philosophy.* A guy like Gardy cannot possibly miss the Indians, and probably overrates them, due to their Twins-like ability to contend despite annual offseason disappointment.

<em>* Did I just give a major hint as to the difference in philosophy between the two most consistently efficient baseball teams in the league. Yes. Yes I did. I still hope to write about that soon.</em>
<blockquote>Gardenhire comes out of a different division than the Yankees and Red Sox, not the Central as much as the baseball division that doesn't have their money and never will. Somehow the Twins, with their tough, old-school manager, always hang tough. Somehow a team from baseball's low-rent district always aims high.</blockquote>
Now this, I take exception to. Baseball's low-rent district? Seriously? Is that just a playful shot at the midwest, or is Lupica being ignorant?

For one thing, the AL Central has 4 of the top 11 winningest teams over the last 3 years. We are the <em>only</em> division that can say that. So ... winning more games than the other divisions. Doesn't sound low-rent to me. But let's look at dollars, because that's all the New Yorkers understand.

Here are the combined divisional averages over the last three years:

AL East: 574.57 (2 in top 10) (avg $114.914)
AL Central: 407.69 (2 in top 10) (avg $81.54)
AL West: 372.77 (2 in top 10) (avg $93.19)
NL East: 406.32 (2 in top 10) (avg $81.26)
NL Central: 514.12 (1 in top 10) (avg $85.69)
NL West: 420.31 (1 in top 10) (avg $84.06)

Obviously the AL East is the most expensive division. The Yankees and Red Sox play there, and they have free global publicity from <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Red Sox Nation</span> ESPN. And the Orioles aren't exactly thrifty with their cash.

The other division with a New York Team? Well, it's the only division in baseball that averages less payroll per team than the AL Central. Sure doesn't sound like the AL Central is <em>the</em> low-rent division, right? Also, averaged out over three years, the difference between $81.26M, $81.54M, $84.06M, and $85.59M is just not that big. In fact, these salaries represent the average MLB payroll, and they're the bottom four divisions.

And the AL Central has two teams in the top ten in payroll. Which is tied for first along with the AL East, AL West, and NL East. If the AL Central were truly <em>the</em> low-rent division, surely they wouldn't have as many Top 10 Payrolls as the vaunted super-spenders of the AL East and NL East? Right?

The AL Central has 4 of the best 10 teams in baseball (based on winning baseball games, rather than the opinions of ESPN writers). The AL Central spends money in line with the rest of the league, rather than significantly below some kind of budget watermark.

Even when a New York writer takes it upon himself to try to compliment Gardy and the Twins, he can't help but demonstrate a complete lack of knowledge of how the league works outside the Yankees / Red Sox rivalry. And I think that's sad.
