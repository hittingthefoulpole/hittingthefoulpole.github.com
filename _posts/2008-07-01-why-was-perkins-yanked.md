In the ballgame last night, Scott Ullger decided to take Perkins out with one on and one out in the 7th. It looked to me like Perkins had settled into a groove and could have gotten two more outs in that inning. Instead, Ullger decided to remove him and bring in Jesse Crain to face Edgar Renteria. He then used a series of several more ineffective relievers.  Not sure what he was thinking.  Would Gardy have done the same thing? I'm not sure.  Thoughts?
