Sometimes Gardy manages to outdo himself. I really ... I mean ... I can't say anything about it. <a href="http://blogs.twincities.com/twins/2008/03/cut_off_in_fort_lauderdale.html">Quote</a>:<br /><small><font face="WorldwideMedium" size="2"><blockquote>“Robin Williams would fit right now for us. He’d be my guy -- multi-talented, lots of different characters. I think he could play anywhere,” Gardenhire said. “If it gets down to that and we all need to get a celebrity in there, it’s either going to be Garth Brooks or Robin Williams, I can’t decide which.”</blockquote>Robin Williams or Garth Brooks? Seriously? I think Gardy misunderstands the "Twins Way" to mean "unathletic, banjo-hitting, uncoordinated, and untalented." Frankly, I think this quote says all there is to say about Gardenhire as a manager.<br /><br />Also got this little tidbit from Phil Miller:<br /></font></small><font face="WorldwideMedium" size="2"><blockquote>Anyway, I stood behind the batting cage for awhile, and heard Nick Punto and Tommy Watkins -- each of them have only one hit this spring -- joking about “not wanting to peak too early.” They’re obviously feeling a little pressure to get going, but they’re keeping their sense of humor.</blockquote><big><small>Yes. At least they have a sense of humor about not being able to hit the ball. Really, that's the most important thing. Not, you know, starting to hit the ball. Fortunately for them, Gardy seems to share their misguided sense of humor. In today's game, Everett is leading off (Gomez bats 9th), and <i>Punto is the DH</i>. If you can come up with two worse decisions for the lineup, I'd like to hear them.<br /><br />If nothing else, Gardy seems to want to give us plenty of fuel. Inexplicable.</small><br /></big></font>
