The Twins kick off a three game set with the Yankees tonight at the Dome.  Pitching matchups are as follows:

Tuesday- Scott Baker vs. CC Sabathia

Wednesday- Glen Perkins vs. AJ Burnett

Thursday- Anthony Swarzak vs. TBA

The Twins have some pretty ugly numbers against CC.  Redmond is one of the few who does not so I wonder if Gardy will DH Mauer (since Kubel would be useless against CC) and use Redmond at Catcher.  Or even vice versa.  Other than that I'm sure the lineup will be pretty normal.  Gardy seems to have settled on one lineup most of the time.  Which is nice.  Its not a good sign when the lineup changes from day to day.  Unless of course you have too many good players, but it usually means you don't have enough.

If we can take two of three from both the Yankees and White Sox I think we will be in very good shape heading into the break.  I'd also be happy with a 3-3 split.  The tigers have now lost three in a row, so maybe they are starting to fade for good. 

Another interesting note:  The Twins are done with the Yankees, Red Sox and Rays after this week.  The Tigers still have a bunch of games left against them.  That is a good sign.
