The Rockies, like most teams, have a system whereby players get promotions in their pre-arbitration years. It's usually mostly based on tenure, with performance considerations added in. (This is why most pre-arbitration players make a little more than the actual minimum salary.)

This can be a complicated thing. A team wants to keep its players happy by giving them raises rather than pinching pennies at the cost of jerking around their young players. At the same time, arbitrators use the amount a player made in his pre-arbitration years as a consideration for what they should make in arbitration. Simply by virtue of giving someone a little extra money when you don't have to, you can corner yourself into paying them <em>considerably</em> more when they hit arbitration.

But apparently, there's another consideration, and this one is from the players' perspective: By "agreeing" to the offered pre-arbitration contract, they can be seen to "agree" with that valuation. And <a href="http://www.insidetherockies.com/2009/03/05/the-boras-factor/">Scott Boras, shockingly, is having none of it</a>:
<blockquote>The Rockies have a very stringent pay scale for pre-arbitration eligible players, and they are consistent with that approach. Boras does not agree with the philosophy and prefers to have his clients not agree to the contract as a matter of principle.</blockquote>
As a result, Boras' three clients on the Rockies will make the minimum instead of whatever slightly-more-than-minimum salary the team offered them. Undoubtedly, Boras will use this "disagreement" against the team in upcoming arbitration battles, pointing out that the team "undervalues" the players and attempted to "take advantage of them."

I'm assuming, of course, that Boras is actually thinking ahead in the interest of making more money for <em>these</em> clients, as opposed to using them as guinea pigs or precedent for other, more talented players down the road, from whom Boras can score a bigger payday in the future. I suspect he does that frequently, but I'm not necessarily here to accuse him of breaking his contract to act in the interest of his clients.

As far as I know, the Twins have only two Boras clients now: Carlos Gomez and Joe Crede. We've taken advantage of Crede's injury situation and a down market to stick it to Boras on that contract -- but Gomez will soon be hitting arbitration, and Boras will probably pull out all the stops to jack up his arbitration prices.

Given that Gomez was a Boras client, it was basically a given that we'd lose him at the end of his arbitration years at the latest, possibly trading him a year or two earlier than that. But given this latest development, is it time to start thinking about trading away Gomez <em>before</em> he even hits arbitration?
