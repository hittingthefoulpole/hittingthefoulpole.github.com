I honestly didn't think we had a very good chance to win that game last night.  That is until the 7th inning when we slammed the door.  The Tigers are built to hit a lot of homers, so a one run lead is basically nothing against them. That is why it was so important we kept hitting the ball and didn't just take that first run of the 7th to the bank.

I thought it was questionable to bring Liriano back out for the 8th.  Everyone knew he was going to be pulled if he got into trouble, and our relievers have shown they are worse than normal when coming in with runners on.  So why not send Guerrier out there to start the 8th?  I guess it doesn't matter since we won the game, but I hope this doesn't become a pattern. 

It looks as though Crede and Cuddyer have finally decided to start hitting the ball.  Its about time some of those second-class citizen right handers started carrying their weight on this team.

Um, Casilla needs to be smacked around for that play in the first.  What in God's name was he thinking?  That was a heads up play by Jackson, but Casilla needs to be fined and/or benched for that play.  How much longer is Gardy going to use Casilla as the starter at second and bat him second?  He has to be close to giving both of those spots to Harris.  He is basically a black hole between our 4 best hitters.  Can you imagine if we had Harris and his 300 + average batting second everyday?  Much better than Casilla and his terrible-ness.

Liriano was good.  He was a little sloppy early when issuing 3 walks, but he was able to strike enough guys out to strand those runners.  Giving up a homer to Cabrera is not big deal as everyone has done it at some point.

I hope Young takes notes from Crede and Cuddyer and starts to hit the ball consistently.  I don't think he is in danger of losing much playing time since Gardy has basically forgotten Gomez exists, so Young will be getting most of the starts in LF for the foreseeable future.
