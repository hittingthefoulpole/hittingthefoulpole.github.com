Scott Baker started for the Twins yesterday afternoon and turned out a fine performance.  Although that Cleveland lineup is terrible.  It has exactly one good hitter: Vic Martinez.  If we had walked him every single time he came up in this series it probably would have been for the best.  Anyway, I'll take a good start from Baker if he gives it to me.  Even if it is against a AAA team and Victor Martinez. 

The top four guys in the lineup were tremendous.  Kubel, Morneau, and Span  homered, Mauer scored 4 runs.  Great day to be at the top of the Twins lineup.  The bottom was as terrible as usual.  Gardy said he wanted to stretch the success of the top of the lineup all the way through the bottom.  That isn't possible when the bottom of your lineup consists of no-talent ass clowns.  They aren't slumping, they are just no good.  Harris-Redmond-Tolbert-Gomez isn't even the worst bottom of the order we could have fielded.  Throw Punto and Young in there and its probably worse. 

Liriano goes tonight against King Felix for the third time this year.  I am bracing for the worst.  And by "bracing" I mean consuming many, many beers.  I'm setting the over/under on innings pitched for Liriano at 4.5.  Leave your picks in the comments section.
