Nick Blackburn got off to a rough start, throwing 44 pitches in the first two innings, but settled down after needing just 5 in the third.  He set a career high with 7 strikeouts, including Jason Bay two times. He seemingly let the leadoff man reach in every inning, but stranded him more often than not, not with the normal Blackburn DP grounder, but with lots of well placed strikeouts.  Guerrier and Nathan combined to look like a ghost of bullpens past in quickly dispatching the Red Sox in the 8th and 9th innings respectively.

On the offensive side of the ball, it was Justin Morneau who provided most of the offense. While the <em>bottom</em>of the order actually contributed.  Even Punto had two hits (I still wish we could let our pitchers bat and DH for either 2B or SS).  Mauer had a rare bad game, notching two strikeouts against Jon Lester.  He did work a walk and score on the Morneau blast.

Delmon Young had another terrible game at the plate, although he did make a nice running catch in left.  The Twins need to do something about him.  He clearly is a talented player, but is simply over matched in the majors.  Can we send him down to triple A for the rest of the season to figure his shit out? If not I think he will become more and more frustrated with each terrible at bat and spiral into the category of "biggest draft busts".  Maybe he will breakout when he is 27 like one Michael Cuddyer, but we can't afford to keep him around for 4-5 years if they will be 4-5 years of terribleness.  We also need to do something about the middle infield situation.  Those two clowns are two black holes in the lineup.  At least Gardy learned to bat them at the bottom of the order.  Took him long enough.

Tonight is Slowey vs. Dice-K, lets try to pull out a series win by getting tonights game, and getting behind Swarzak in the finale tomorrow afternoon against Josh Beckett.
