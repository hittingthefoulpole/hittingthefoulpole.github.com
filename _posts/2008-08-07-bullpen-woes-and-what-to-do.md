An interesting stat just popped up in my daily email from Baseball Prospectus:
<blockquote>Top 5 Most Helpful AL Relievers, by Inherited Runs Prevented

Player, Team, Inh Runs Prevented

Grant Balfour, TBA, 5.1
James Johnson, BAL, 3.6
Jonathan Papelbon, BOS, 3.5
<strong>Bobby Korecky, MIN, 3.2</strong>
Joel Peralta, KCA, 3.2</blockquote>
Wow. Korecky really got the job done in his brief time in the majors. That's an impressive stat considering he only pitched 10.1 innings in 9 games.

Maybe ... just <em>maybe</em> ... he'd be a better fit for the club than Boof or Bass. (By the way, considering the fact that Boof never plays anyway, would we really lose much if someone took him on waivers? And it's his fault that Crain and Guerrier are about to die -- they can't pitch in every game, Gardy!) Also Breslow. Why isn't Breslow pitching? Because he's left handed?

Why are left handed starters valuable but left handed relievers can only face one batter before hitting the showers? <em>Especially</em> since Breslow is better against righties than lefties. Consider ...

vs righties: .185/.313/.204 in 64 PA
vs lefties: .238/.273/.310 in 44 PA

So ... why does he face one guy per week? Those are Neshek numbers. We're lacking a certain Neshek. Why not let this guy try to get people out, rather than sending Crain and Guerrier out to try to keep their arms connected to their shoulders or Bass to try and keep the other team from scoring 10 runs in an inning?

The bullpen is a big weakness right now, and it seems to me that there are a couple of clear upgrades: Korecky and Breslow instead of Boof and Bass, which in turn eases the pressure on Guerrier and Crain. Solves the following problems:
<ul>
	<li>Brian Bass is on our team <em>and</em> has pitched more than any other reliever in the league.</li>
	<li>Breslow pitches once per week despite his good numbers and performances.</li>
	<li>Korecky escapes from Rochester back to the big club where he can save inherited runs (left on the bases for him by Reyes).</li>
	<li>Crain and Guerrier are getting overworked because they're the only non-horrible relievers Gardy is willing to use.</li>
	<li>Boof ... continues to take up space in the pen without doing any actual pitching. Oh well.</li>
</ul>
I don't know about you, but I've had quite enough of these bullpen woes.
