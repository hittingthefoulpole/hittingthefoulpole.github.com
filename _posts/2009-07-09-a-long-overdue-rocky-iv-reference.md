If the head coach of the University of Michigan lost to Ohio State every year, that is basically grounds for firing.  Ron Gardenhire has a sub 300 winning percentage against the Yankees since he became the Twins manager in 2002.  That isn't good.  I'm not sayin he should be fired for losing to a team we only play seven times a year, but  he needs to tell the players that we aren't facing Ruth and Gehrig everytime we play them.  We need to cut them, like in Rocky IV, after Rocky makes Drago bleed and Duke (his trainer) says  "You see? You see? He's not a machine, he's a man, he's a man"  Well right now, the Twins think the Yankees are a machine.  If Liriano can come out today and shut them down for 7 innings he can show the rest of the team that they are just men.  Same as any other team (just more expensive). 

When we faced the Yankees back in May we walked them twice as much as they normally draw walks on a per game basis.  I'm pretty sure this is because our pitchers were scared of them.  Swarzak didn't look too bad last night and he didn't give up.  He kept trying to make his pitches, but those damn Yankees are so damn patient.  Jerks.

Let's hope the title of my next blog post can be "They're cut! The Yankees are cut!", and not "If they die, they die".
