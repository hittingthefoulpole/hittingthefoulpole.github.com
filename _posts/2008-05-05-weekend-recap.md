Well, that was fun. Nothing like sweeping two rivals in one week. Lets start with friday. How Livan didn't give up more than one run boggles my mind. It seems that even his outs were loud, but as the saying goes: don't question miracles. Or something like that. The bats looked good on friday, consistent pounding the ball.  We got production from the entire lineup, which was awesome.  We only had one homer, but had 4 doubles and a triple to go with our 10 singles. The only person to go hitless was, surprise, Nick Punto. I can't believe Ullger played him in Center.

Saturday was also good. Not a blowout. In fact it was very close most of the game. Craig was able to put it away with this second homer of the year.  The hero of the game was Brian Bass, with 4 shutout innings in relief of the injured Scott Baker.

After watching the first inning on sunday I was upset that the Twins were going lose the third game of a series in a blowout, something they seem to do all too often. After winning the first two they totally shut down on sunday and get trampled. However, they didn't give up. They kept chipping away, and Boof righted the ship after the worst first inning I've seen in a while.

It was good to see Mauer catch all 5 games of the homestand. He looked good at the plate too, and I think he is going to have a big summer. Let's hope Baker doesn't need to go on the DL, but if he does Slowey will be ready to pitch in Chicago. So lets head to the south side and sitck it to the Sox again. Go Twins!
