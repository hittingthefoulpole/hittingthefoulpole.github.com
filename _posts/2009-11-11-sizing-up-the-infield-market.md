The <a href="http://mlb.fanhouse.com/2009/11/10/money-worries-could-force-reds-to-move-all-star-phillips-others/">Fanhouse GM meetings update</a> states that the Reds are having money woes and will need to shed a ton of payroll.  One of the trade candidates is <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=791&amp;position=2B">Brandon Phillips</a>.  I'm sure the price would be high to get him, since the Reds need cheap players who will be under team control for a long time.  These are the Twins favorite type of players.  Phillips is set to make around 7 million next season, which is a bargain considering the power he has out of the second base position.  I know a lot of people have been mentioning <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1176&amp;position=2B">Polanco</a>as a candidate to play second base, and he is a very nice player.  However, if we can get Brandon Phillips for someone like Glen Perkins I think we should do it.  He is a very complete player, he was a 20-20 guy last year.  His on-base skills leave something to be desired, his career OBP is .312.  Not good. At all. So when we are deciding between Polanco and Phillips you are basically choosing power or OBP.  I'd be happy with either, and adding Polanco gives us a nice #2 hitter, whereas Phillips is better suited further down in the order.  The problem with going after these two guys is it leaves us with Punto at third, and if its Phillips, no clear #2 hitter.

The thirdbase market consists basically of <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1580&amp;position=3B/OF">Chone Figgins</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=639&amp;position=3B">Adrian Beltre</a>.  Both will probably be very expensive, with Beltre probably getting more because he is a power hitter and everyone overpays for homers.  If I was running the show I would go after Figgins.  I think Gardy would like him since he is scrappy and doesn't hit for power, like Punto, but unlike Punto he is, you know, good.  Man, how good would that career 363 OBP look between Span and Mauer?  Gardy would get his way, having fast guys at the top of the lineup, but those fast guys would also have high OBPs.  I think the main reason I want Figgins is because it would make the lineup Gardy-proof. Span-Figgins-Mauer-Morneau-Cuddyer-Kubel-Hardy-Young-Punto. Not too shabby and there is really no other way to construct it, except maybe flip-flop Cuddyer and Kubel.

I really hope that Smith and his brain trust aren't content with Punto as a starting infielder and do the due diligence on ones that are available either through free agency or a trade.  The two most glaring holes are obviously second and third base, and I think we need to fill one of them, with Punto playing the other.
