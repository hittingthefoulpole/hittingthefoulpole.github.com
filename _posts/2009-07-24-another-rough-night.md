There wasn't really one thing that went wrong last night.  Nathan screwed up.  I think he can do that once every 25 times he pitches or so.  Instead of 25 times every one time he pitches, Jesse Crain style. 

 

Other than that I don't have much to say.  I'm out of town this weekend so maybe me not watching the Twins will cause them to win.  Stranger things have happened.
