When Eric Gagne signed with the Brewers for up to $1.5M with incentives after receiving a guaranteed offer of $3M from the Twins, I have to admit I was pretty incensed. Which you probably noticed if you read that article.

Well, it turns out that the Twins were almost certainly right to pull that offer and lucky that Gagne didn't eagerly jump on it. (Boras' genius is waiting for better offers and pushing up the price. His failing is that he needs to realize when he's selling a lemon and as soon as an offer comes in that he knows is well above what his product is worth, and immediately take the offer, get it signed, and laugh.)

It turns out that <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/03/09/twins-were-wise-to-pass-on-gagne-cordero-update/">Gagne has The Jesse Crain Special</a>, a torn labrum and rotator cuff, and will probably need season-ending shoulder surgery. He was released by the Brewers on Sunday and won't be getting that $1.5M he would have gotten had he made the team.

Is this the end for Gagne? Maybe. He'll probably try to go somewhere next year, and some GM that's been asleep at the wheel for the last five years will probably sign him. Thankfully, that almost certainly won't be the Twins.
