On a night where the offense wasn't clicking, despite making Justin Masterson work, Slowey held the Indians in check and the Twins took advantage of several Cleveland miscues.

I was really impressed with the way Slowey pitches tonight.  He was hitting all his spots, had an outstanding strike to ball ratio, and didn't walk a single batter.  He seemed to be hitting all of his spots, and his only mistake was a bad pitch to Hafner.  We couldn't really ask for a better start out of him.  Ideally Liriano was taking notes, so he now has a good idea how to attack this Cleveland lineup on Wednesday night.  I'm happy Gardy didn't send Slowey back out for the ninth just to get him a complete game.  His pitch count probably could have handled it (he was at 98 after 8), but with the heart of the Indians order coming up, why risk it?  Duensing wasn't messing around either.  He came in for the ninth and just fired in strikes to the 3-4-5 hitters for Cleveland.  He threw 11 pitches, 9 for strikes.  The team totals were 109 pitches, 79 for strikes.  72%! That is insane. Hopefully Slowey (and the rest of the staff) can build off this.

On the offensive side of things, the picture isn't as rosy.  The offense loaded the bases several times, again, and failed to do much of anything.  We did manage to score three times on one such occassion, without a hit.   I shudder to think what our team batting average with the bases loaded is.  The sample size isn't really small either, we've had the bases juiced a lot.

Mauer failed to reach base for the first time since last September.  A grand total of 35ish games.  Pretty impressive.  

Not a bad win, I really like that the Twins longest losing streak of the season is one game.  If we can avoid losing back to back games for the rest of the year, that would be great. What? You say that is impossible? Well, nobody asked you.

Tonight is Liriano vs. David Huff.  It is also apparently Xcel energy light bulb night.  Why don't they just make it nickle beer night while they're at it. #StupidPromotions
