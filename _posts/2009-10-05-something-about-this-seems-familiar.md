A few notes before the tiebreaker game tomorrow
<ul>
	<li>MLB finally decided to change their lame coin toss rule.  As you all know since we beat the Tigers in the season series we will play at the dome.  That is excellent news.</li>
	<li>I attended both the saturday and sunday games.  My friends and I had a few beverages before and during the saturday game, and afterwards decided to wait around and harass Patrick Ruesse, he got upset and had us removed from the stadium.  It was most excellent.</li>
	<li>Both Blackburn and Pavano pitched on short rest and came up big.  Pavano wasn't great, but he was good enough.  Especially when Jason Kubel outscored the entire Royals team.  With two swing of the bat. He is probably my favorite Twin.</li>
	<li>Scott Baker will start for the Twins tomorrow afternoon.  The Tigers will be tossing Rick Porcello.  I'm glad we have Baker going.  He has been our best pitcher since about May, so I can't think of anyone I'd rather have.  Blackburn maybe since he has come up big down the stretch.  Baker needs to stay efficient with his pitches and not be out by the 5th because of a high pitch count. </li>
	<li>While I would have liked to play the tiebreaker today, having a day off is nice so the bullpen can be rested.  Hopefully we don't need them to pitch too many innings.</li>
	<li>I read somewhere that the Twins are trying to get a white out going at the dome tomorrow.  Everyone wear white and bust out your homer hankies. Its October baseball.  Or Rocktober, if you will.</li>
</ul>
