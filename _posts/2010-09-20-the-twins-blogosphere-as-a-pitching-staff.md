Late Monday afternoon, a tweet came fluttering to my attention, borne by the whispering aether that is the internet. It was brilliant in its simplicity, yet invited so much thought, I couldn't let it pass by un-considered.

> **What would a batting order of Twins blogs look like?** [@TwinkieTown](http://twitter.com/TwinkieTown/status/25057233234)

Now, perhaps it wasn't supposed to be some soft of profound question, cutting straight to the heart of the blogosphere. Perhaps its author was merely bored, waiting for the Twins game to start. Perhaps it doesn't matter one way or the other, as it happens, because once inspiration strikes the damage is done. It's much like lightning in that way.

Now, I personally didn't agree with the idea of a batting order. The idea of fitting together a pitching staff suited my fancy much better -- and since I was the one who was doing all the thinking about it, I figured I'd just go with it.

Take a walk with me, if you will, through the Twins blogosphere. And please do bear in mind that there are no right or wrong answers here -- even more so than usual, that is -- and there are no stats here. If you read all these blogs already, then you probably know even better than I do that this is all just so much nonsense. On the other hand, you might find a new blog to check out. And that would make the whole thing worthwhile.

## Rotation

### Ace: [Aaron Gleeman](http://aarongleeman.com/)

The veteran of the staff, and the most respected around the league -- most teams don't have an Ace like Gleeman. If effective writing is a fastball and statistical analysis is breaking balls, then Gleeman has pretty good stuff. And if wordcount says anything about how deep he can go into games, then he can give the bullpen a break pretty much every time out.

### Second Starter: [Seth Speaks](http://www.sethspeaks.net/)

The second starter is Seth Stohs, who does excellent work with the Twins' farm system, produces a regular podcast, and is consistently interesting and thoughtful. You could do worse in a #2 starter. From what I can tell, he's also a go-to guy on Twitter when someone wants a question answered; he manages to combine a great understanding of the game with a significant following and, somehow, a lack of the arrogance that typically comes with people caring about what you think.

### Third Starter: [Nick's Twins Blog](http://www.nickstwinsblog.com/)

Nick Nelson is so good his blog was picked up by the ESPN SweetSpot network, but he still writes about the Twins, so he's eligible to be on this team. Once again, consistent and thoughful: the Twins Blogosphere has a pretty good playoff rotation. He's got the good fastball, he has good command of his breaking stuff (stats), and he posts regularly.

### Fourth Starter: [Twinkie Town](http://www.twinkietown.com/)

This is a very active community blog. They have a sizable team of writers, constantly refreshing their page with new content. Seriously: they post several new articles every day. A lot of managers like to have an innings eater on staff, and that's what you'll get at Twinkie Town; guaranteed innings. So if you're feeling bored, feel free to go get sucked in.

### Fifth Starter: [Twins Geek](http://twinsgeek.blogspot.com/)

It's probably unfair to call John Bonnes of Twins Geek the fifth starter; he knows his baseball and can write a fair bit too. His penchant for coming up with interesting takes without getting _too_ bogged down in esoteric numbers is refreshing, and he'll frequently whip out a good non-stats article to keep you on your toes. I originally had him anchoring the bullpen, but you can get more value out of a starter than you can out of a reliever. I think he'd appreciate that.

## Bullpen

### Closer: [The WGOM](http://stickandballguy.com/blog)

You don't need a closer every day -- though you'd like him to be available at any time -- but when you do need him you want him to have a blazing fastball, a biting slider, and a certain presence on the mound. You want stats? You want analysis? You want funny stories? You want to bring in this team of writers, led by StickAndBallGuy, to finish off the game for you.

### Setup man: [Over the Baggy](http://overthebaggy.blogspot.com/)

Graphs. Charts. Numbers. Good ideas. When you've got a narrow lead late in the game, those are the kinds of pitches that will maintain that lead. The author, Parker Hageman, "takes a sober, performance-based view of players, letting others fall for a player's heart or his leadership skills in the clubhouse." What I mean is, he has good command of his breaking ball.

### LOOGY: [A Fan's View](http://www.startribune.com/blogs/A_Fans_View.html)

If you need to get a tough lefty, you don't necessarily need the biggest fastball or the most advanced numbers -- sometimes it's best to come at him from an angle he wouldn't expect. Howard Sinker writes for the Star Tribune, but he does it from the fan's perspective -- he's not a beat writer. Sometimes a little off the beaten trail, but he'll keep your spirits up when the team is getting you down.

### Middle relief: [k-bro's baseball blog](http://kbrobaseball.blogspot.com/)

k-bro may not bring the stats as consistently as many other bloggers do, but don't take that as a criticism; if the entire blogosphere was all-stats-all-the-time, it'd be just as bad as the no-stats-ever Mainstream Old Guy Media that thinks blogs are just for stats in the first place. The point is, you don't need to have a lot of numbers on your pages to write a good blog, and k-bro writes a good blog.

### Long relief: [Josh's Thoughts](http://joshsopinion.blogspot.com/)

Your long reliever doesn't get into a lot of games, but when he does come in you're going to want him to give you some innings. And Josh Johnson -- who has the sort of name that makes you think he's got a future in this game -- doesn't disappoint when he takes the mound. He hasn't posted much recently, but when he does it's a lengthy, well-considered article in which he does an excellent job articulating his ideas. Like most long relievers, you hope that he can gain some consistency and earn a spot in the starting rotation some day.

That was fun ... and more difficult than I thought it would be. Figuring out who was a better baseball player than whom must have been quite the ordeal back in those dark days before Baseball-Reference and Fangraphs existed. And maybe I'm just getting ready to get old, but it seems to me that if there's ever a site that actually _measures_ baseball bloggers on objective metrics and ostensibly assigns a "value" to them, well, blogging will have gotten just a little more fun. A dark day, you might say.

Unless those stats tell me that I'm good, in which case I'm all for them.
