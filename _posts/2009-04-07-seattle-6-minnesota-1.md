Well, that was a bit of a setback. 

First, the pitchers. Liriano didn't look terrible, despite giving up 4 runs.  He went 7, walked 0, but only struck out 3.   He made a mistake pitch to Junior, and Junior doesn't let too many mistake pitches go by, even if he is old as hell.  The homer by Gutierrezwasn't as much of a mistake, but he was sitting fastball and when Liriano fired one in there Gutierrez was ready for it. Luis Ayala didn't look half bad.  Retiring the Mariners on 11 pitches, 9 of them strikes. The other three guys, not as much.  Crain threw  16 pitches, only 8 for strikes.  Then for some reason Gardy brought Breslow in to face Junior, and he walked him on four pitches.  It seemed like he was pitching very cautiously, so why not just intentionally walk him with Crain?  Oh well, that doesn't really matter in the grand scheme. 

On to the hitters, we had one extra base hit.  We had the bases loaded with no outs and scored one run.  You CANNOT do these things and expect to win ballgames.  Span looked comfortable out there, coaxing two walks.  Nobody else really impressed me.  I think once our hitters saw Hernandez start to get into a groove they got desperate and started taking bad approaches at the plate.  That is not a good thing.

Is anyone else worried that Gardy is going to play favorites with the outfielders, and not give Delmon is fair shake?  I think Cuddyer will get more at bats than he deserves.  He looked lost at the plate last night, he accounted for 3 of Hernandez's six strikeouts.  At least one of which was looking.  Obviously, I think Delmon will play tonight, with Kubel probably sitting.  I don't know Span's numbers against lefties off the top of my head, but I don't like the idea of sitting out leadoff hitter sometimes.  Whoever bats leadoff needs to be a fixture in the lineup everyday. 

Redmond hurt is groin running the bases, hopefully he isn't out too long or we will have a Morales/Butera platoon behind the plate.  And nobody wants that.

Well, we have 161 more.  And Felix Hernandez won't be pitching in all of them.
