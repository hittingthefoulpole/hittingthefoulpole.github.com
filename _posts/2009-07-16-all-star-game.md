I know the All-Star game was on Tuesday, and this is Thursday, but I wanted to post some comments anyway.  Now, I have mixed feelings about the all-star game.  The fact every team needs a rep and it counts doesn't make sense to me.  Either let managers manage to win, or tell them it doesn't matter and to have fun.  You can't have both, Bud.

Every all-star game has its flaws.  The NBA plays no defense (as if they ever do), the NHL plays their game on a Tuesday afternoon on versus or some crap, and the Pro-Bowl exists.  So of the four major sports I would say baseball is the best.  I also think the baseball all-star game is the most salvageable.  Those comments deserve their own post, though

This years game was actually quite good.  The managers managed to win.  The game moved at a nice pace (maybe that is because no Red Sox or Yankee starting pitchers got into the game).  It was played like a real god-damned baseball game.  I hope this has become the norm and not the exception to the rule.  Most times I find myself watching something else and flipping back to the all-star game every so often, but this year I was glued to my set.  I even watched all the pre-game stuff.  Joe Buck is still terrible, and the fact that he fake laughed directly into his mic when Obama told the "we're out of money" joke was awful.  I enjoyed the fact that a) Obama cheered for one team and didn't wear a generic MLB jacket (even if it is the dastardly white sox) and b) he hated on the Nats.  This comes from someone who has never and will never vote democrat in his life.  So take your compliments, because those will be the last you ever get from this guy. 

The Twins are off today, but start a 9 game west coast road trip starting Friday in Texas.  What are the chances that while playing in the brutal heat on Sunday, Mike Redmond suffers heat stroke and goes on the DL?  I kind of hope its high, because that is the only way Morales will get any PT behind Mauer.  Not that I wish ill will on Redmond, but Morales is just the better player.  Simple as that.
