Last night, AJ Pierzynski hit a home run that was kept fair down the right field line by the swirling Chicago wind; later in the game, Joe Mauer blasted a homer of his own to center field. So Bill took it upon himself to [mock the recent "the Twins would have been better off with AJ than Mauer" thing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/j-pierzynski-meant-more-minnesota-twins-joe-mauer-184200026--mlb.html) that has, for some reason, happened.

> While Mauer has had a great career so far, with three batting titles and a American League MVP Award, I can't help but wonder if the team would have been more successful with Pierzynski instead of Mauer.

So, sure, Mauer is a historically great baseball player, who happens to be highly marketable and well liked. But what if the Twins didn't have him? That'd be a good thing, no?

> Let's not forget, it was Pierzynski who helped the Twins win their only playoff series in the past decade. Plus, after leaving the Giants, Pierzynski hooked on with the Chicago White Sox and helped them win the 2005 World Series over the Houston Astros.

Point one in AJ's favor: he's been on more teams that have had more postseason success than Mauer has. And he received a World Series ring!

I don't know, I don't really think that makes him _a better player_ than Mauer.

> Mauer is a better individual player than Pierzynski. No question. 

Oh, right. Well, then what were we talking about again?

> In my opinion, some decent numbers and durability are better than great numbers and a penchant for winding up in the training room. Nobody ever talked about moving Pierzynski to first base while he was a Twin. Manager Ron Gardenhire never made it a point to give Pierzynski a day game off after a night game. Pierzynski is tough. He picks fights. He gets under the skin of opposing players. He would have been a great asset for a Twins team desperate for a guy who can stir the pot, but still play the game well.

Is it true that "decent numbers and durability" are more valuable to a baseball team than "great numbers and a penchant for winding up in the training room"? Would the Twins _really_ have been better off if they'd never made that fateful 2004 trade that sent Pierzynski away in return for Joe Nathan, Francisco Liriano, and Boof Bonser, and opened up a position for top prospect local golden child Joe Mauer?

Here are Pierzynski's yearly WAR and salary since 2004:

* 2004: 1.3 WAR, $3.5M
* 2005: 1.9 WAR, $2.3M
* 2006: 2.1 WAR, $4.0M
* 2007: 1.1 WAR, $5.5M
* 2008: 1.1 WAR, $5.9M
* 2009: 2.1 WAR, $6.3M
* 2010: 1.2 WAR, $6.3M
* 2011: 1.4 WAR, $2M
* 2012: 1.5 WAR (so far), $6M

First, let's compare to what Mauer has produced in the same time frame:

* 2004: 1.2 WAR, $0.3M
* 2005: 3.4 WAR, $0.3M
* 2006: 6.4 WAR, $0.4M
* 2007: 3.1 WAR, $3.8M
* 2008: 6.1 WAR, $6.3M
* 2009: 7.9 WAR, $10.5M
* 2010: 5.5 WAR, $12.5M
* 2011: 1.6 WAR, $23M
* 2012: 1.5 WAR (so far), $23M

So far, just getting rid of AJ and replacing him with Mauer seems like it was a pretty smart decision. That's a lot of WAR. (Remember that WAR is a counting stat, so Mauer's durability issues are taken into the account by the fact that he's unable to amass WAR when he's not playing.) Is there any gravy? Like, from production received from the pieces returned in that trade?

Joe Nathan:

* 2004: 3.1 WAR, $0.4M
* 2005: 2.7 WAR, $2.1M
* 2006: 3.1 WAR, $3.8M
* 2007: 2.2 WAR, $5.3M
* 2008: 2.1 WAR, $6.0M
* 2009: 1.9 WAR, $11.3M
* 2010: 0 WAR (didn't play), $11.3M
* 2011: 0 WAR (sucked), $11.3M (plus $2M buyout of 2012 option)

WAR isn't a great way to evaluate relief pitchers ... some say because it overvalues relievers and other say it's because WAR undervalues their contribution. But those are some damn fine numbers, especially before he signed his big contract and got expensive and old and broken.

Francisco Liriano:

* 2005: 0.6 WAR (21 IP cup of coffee), one month of pro-rated $0.3M salary, so like nothing
* 2006: 4.1 WAR (98 IP of untouchability), $0.3M
* 2007: 0 WAR (hurt, didn't play), $0.4M
* 2008: 1.5 WAR, $0.4M
* 2009: 1.1 WAR, $0.4M
* 2010: 6.0 WAR, $1.6M
* 2011: 1.0 WAR, $4.3M
* 2012: -0.4 WAR (so far), $5.5M

Say what you will about him, but he's had two tremendous seasons and a lot of hurt/ineffective seasons. He's currently mired in his worst season yet -- he was way better in 2007 when he wasn't on the mound. His future with the team seems like it's somewhere between murky and nonexistent, but here we're measuring what he's provided in the past. And he provided some things.

Boof Bonser:

* 2006: 1.3 WAR, $0.4M
* 2007: 1.6 WAR, $0.4M
* 2008: 1.2 WAR, $0.4M

Nothing special ... but is it worth mentioning that in two of those three years he produced more value to his team than AJ Pierzynski did to is? And this guy was the worst part of the trade? The cherry on top of the gravy, if you will?

Let's add it up, shall we, in case your mind isn't quite blown yet.

* AJ Pierzynski, 2004-2012: 13.7 WAR, for $41.8M
* Joe Mauer, 2004-2012: 36.7 WAR, for $80.1M
* Joe Nathan, from 2004-2011: 15.2 WAR, for $42.2M
* Francisco Liriano, from 2005-2012: 13.9 WAR, for $12.9M
* Boof Bonser, from 2006-2008: 4.1 WAR, for $1.2M
* The three trade pieces combined: 33.2 WAR, for $56.3M

Despite his myriad injuries and his large contract, Mauer has produced three times as much on the field as AJ, with a better WAR/$ ratio. Despite his injuries and his expensive contract during which he barely played, Nathan produced more WAR with a better WAR/$ ratio. Despite his injuries and long, long periods of terribleness, Liriano produced more WAR with a better WAR/$ ratio. Bonser wasn't around long, but as mentioned before he produced more WAR than AJ for 2/3 of the years he was with the Twins, at a much better WAR/$ ratio.

I want to make clear that I don't mean to take anything away from AJ Pierzynski here. He's been a really good, solid, consistent, and durable player for a long time. He may be the best full-time catcher in baseball.* Personality-wise, he's the sort of player you _love_ when he's on your team, and _hate_ when he's on the other team. In terms of having a guy like that on your team, it seems like a plus. I'm sure the White Sox are quite happy with having AJ Pierzynski around, and he'll probably get some decent contract offers after this season.

_* Seriously. Any catcher who's better than Pierzynski also sees time at another position. Mauer spends time at DH and 1B. So do Carlos Santana and Matt Wieters. Buster Posey sees 1B from time to time. Maybe Carlos Ruiz or Yadier Molina is a better full time catcher? Pretty short list._

I'm just saying, it's kind of ludicrous to suggest that the Twins haven't come out ahead by letting him move on to greener pastures. They replaced him with a truly, transcendently great player at the same position. They traded him for what seems to be a patently unfair haul, one of the most lopsided trades of the past decade, and possibly one of the reasons teams are so reluctant to make deals like that involving promising young players any more.* The Twins won this one. Big time.

_* Along with the Bartolo Colon for Grady Sizemore, Brandon Phillips, and Cliff Lee trade and the Mark Teixeira for Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Elvis Andrus, Matt Harrison, and Neftali Feliz trade. Like, oops._

I get that Twins fans are in pain right now. There hasn't been much lately to cling to, to be happy about, to hang our collective hats on. It's become a fun bloodsport to attack the failings of the Ryan/Smith/Ryan succession of general management. But that doesn't mean we should paint those few good things with the same brush.
