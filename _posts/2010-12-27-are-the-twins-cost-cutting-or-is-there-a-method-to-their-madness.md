We here at hitting the foul pole have been pretty busy lately, that is why we haven't posted in over a month.  Obviously a lot has gone on since Thanksgiving.  The team successfully bid on, and signed infielder Tsuyoshi Nishioka, traded JJ Hardy for two minor league relief pitchers, let Jesse Crain and Matt Guerrier leave to sign 3 year contracts, we picked up someone named Scott Diamond in the Rule V draft,  and Carl Pavano is still on the market. Oh, and Joe Mauer had minor knee surgery.

I still find myself upset at the Hardy trade.  When healthy, he was one of the top shorstops in the AL (if not all of Major League Baseball), so he deservedly was due a raise.  All estimates I have seen were that he would be bumped up to the 7-8 million dollar range.  According to <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3797&amp;position=SS#value">Fangraphs</a> he was worth 9.5 million, ais projected to be worth 12.8 next season.  I'm not math whiz, but if we can get12.8 million for 7 or 8, that is a pretty good deal.  Color me confused.

So not only did we trade an excellent SS, we let Hudson walk.  I have no problem with that move, but by getting rid of both middle infielders and replacing them with two giant question marks in Nishioka and Casilla seems the Twins are taking an unneccessary risk.  My guess is Bill Smith and co will use this money to attempt to retain Pavano. Which apparently <a href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/12/27/carl-pavano-is-holding-out-for-a-three-year-contract/">will require three years</a>.

MISTAKE!!!

In what universe is giving a pitcher with an extensive injury history on the wrong side of 30, a good idea? Oh, and coming off a career year?  Does anyone really think Pavano can repeat 2010 once, let alone thrice?

The Hardy trade did net us two relief pitchers, one of which might be able to contribute in 2011.  The bullpen is a freaking disaster right now, so I guess any help will come in handy. There are definitely some internal candidates such as Delaney, Slama, Burnett, and Manship, and bounceback years from Nathan and Neshek would be welcome surprises. Re-signing Jon Rauch is also an option if the price is right, but for someone who had 20+ saves last year it won't be. What I'm trying to say, is the bullpen could be OK if everything swings our way, which obviously won't happen.  I'm not saying we should have handed three year contracts to Crain and/or Guerrier, but it is unfortunate that they both became prized free agents at the same time.

According to my twitter feed, I'm not the only one who has been discouraged by the offseason moves so far.  Let's hope once the calendar turns to 2011, Bill Smith and his brain trust make some moves to solidify the relief corps, and add depth to the bench.
