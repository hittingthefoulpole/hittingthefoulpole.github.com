There is no reason Jason Kubel should sit ever again.  Hitting that second homer off of a lefty should secure him a spot in the lineup tonight against White Sox lefthander Mark Buehrle, if not it probably means gardy will still be drunk when he makes the lineup card.  I think he pretty much has to go with the same lineup tonight, Mauer and Morneau kill lefties, so you can't sit them (and they are our two best hitters so you never should sit them based on "the percentages"), Kubel should play, he is our third best hitter (as sirsean asked me rhetorically in a text message last night "do david ortiz and ryan howard sit against lefties?"), and you can't possibly sit Span after what he has done both offensively and defensively lately.  Cuddyer just hasn't done much to earn a spot in the lineup, and going forward each game is more important than the last so we can't afford to have one guy in the lineup who is "getting his timing bacK".

Lets hope Blackburn feeds off the energy of the crowd, and the momentum of the last two good outings by starters.  Thoughts on the lineup for tonight? or the game in general?

<strong>UPDATE: </strong>I just read over on Joe C's blog post from last night that Cuddyer will indeed play tonight. I'm assuming that he will DH, so looks like Gardy ignored the first sentence of this post. Thats a bummer, dude.
