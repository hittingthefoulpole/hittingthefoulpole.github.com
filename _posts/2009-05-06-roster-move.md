<a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/">According to LEN3</a> the Twins are expected to make a roster move before today's game.  It seemed as though everyone in the clubhouse expressed their displeasure with Casilla's mistakes over the last two games. 

If you do the simple math in the above summary of Neal's post, you will understand that the Twins will probably send Casilla to AAA.  This is probably for the best.  Not only has he been a black hole at the plate, but he has been bringing those at bats into the field and making terrible mental errors, some of which are actual errors in the boxscore.

The obvious choice to replace him on the roster is Matt Tolbert.  While I don't necessarily agree that this is the best choice, everyone knows Gardy loves him some Tolbert so he will be the first guy up when we need an infielder. Hopefully Harris gets most (or ideally all) of the starts at second until Casilla proves he is a major league starter.  Something he really hasn't shown since his wrist injury last summer.  As much as I hate to say it, Casilla is forcing me to draw comparisons to Luis Rivas.  Very talented, but just can't seem to put the pieces together for more than a few games at a time.  We (sirsean in particular) have always been strong supporters of Casilla, but if he is going to play like a goddamn idiot out there, its hard to say he should be in the lineup everyday. 

As long as we are booking flights from Rochester to Baltimore and vice versa, can we please send Luis Ayala away?  There are several capable relievers in AAA (Delaney, Slama to name a few) that I would rather have in there than Ayala.  The Ayala signing didn't get as much flak as the Ponson-esque signings did in the past, but it is very similar.  We signed a pitcher who is a crappy veteran to shore up the bullpen, when we had a few capable young arms in the organization already.  We have done the same thing with our starting rotation in the past, but I would argue this is just as bad since the bullpen was our biggest weakness last season.   So using a repair method that never worked on other parts of our team is a pretty silly way to solve a problem.  However, I doubt they will move Ayala. Although I have heard rumblings that Gardy has been discussing Slama with Wild Bill.  Bringing up a power pitcher who can strike people out is obviously and improvement over Luis Ayala.  Hell, I might be an improvement over Ayala.  At least I'm left handed.

What are you thoughts on Casilla, and any other roster moves we should make as we start the second month of the season?
