The Twins made a big splash yesterday by <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100204&amp;content_id=8020848&amp;vkey=news_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min">signing</a> their second ex-Dodger, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1307&amp;position=2B">Orlando Hudson</a>. This is excellent news because Hudson fills two needs. A secondbaseman and a #2 hitter. Last season with the Dodgers Hudson hit .283/.357/.415, that will look pretty damn good between Span and Mauer.  Defensively, Hudson has lost a step or two lately, but that didn't stop him from winning a gold glove in 2009. He had a pretty bad UZR/150 number (-3.7), but he must be flashy enough that people think he deserved one.   Regardless, I think he will be adequate defensively, especially if Punto is covering some extra ground at third.

Last season Hudson was paid $3.4 million, but according to fangraphs he was worth a cool $13 million. He was worth 2.9 wins above replacement in 2009, nothing to sneeze at.

For $5 million dollars and one year, I think this is an excellent signing. The biggest question has to be what happens to Punto? There is no way Gardy doesn't start him, and I guess I don't have a huge problem with him starting at third. Maybe platooning with Harris, who has historically hit well against lefties. I see the batting order working out like this
Span-CF
Hudson- 2B
Mauer-C
Morneau-1B
Cuddyer- RF
Kubel-DH
Hardy- SS
Young- LF
Punto/Harris- 3B

That's a pretty solid lineup. Throwing in Thome every once in a while won't be taking a step backwards, like it usually is when you rest a starter.

So the way I see it, the Twins payroll is now around 95 or 96 million.  I'm glad the Pohlad family wasn't just blowing hot air when they said payroll would increase with the opening of Target Field.  Everyone get excited, spring training is just around the corner.
