The Twins had an excellent weekend against the Angels.  This series had a little bit of everything.  A thrilling come from behind win (Friday) a blowout (Saturday), and a close-ish game (Sunday).

During the game on Friday, our terrible bullpen was on display.  As they were giving up a parade of hits to the Angels, I was about ready to give up on the team.  They seemed unable to do anything right or good.  Then came Jason Kubel.  Even before the grand slam, he had put together a pretty good game, which was overshadowed by our terrible bullpen.  You know how it ended, so I will spare you. 

I attended the game on Saturday and it was pretty ho-hum.  Kevin Slowey made one mistake, a two run homer to Hunter.  The Twins actually trailed until the 5th inning when they took the lead for good.  It would be nice to see them take the first lead of the game and hold it wire to wire, but I'll take what I can get.

Sunday brought another superb pitching performance from Perkins not only did he shutdown the Angels, but he took a comebacker off the leg and walked it off.  What a badass.

I hope nobody missed the good parts of the game on friday, if you did you better have been doing something really awesome.  Skydiving is one acceptable excuse.  Something involving supermodels is OK too.
