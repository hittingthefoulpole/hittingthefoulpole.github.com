With exactly one good start from our group of young pitchers (minus Baker) is it time to hit the panic button in Twins land?  It is more than possible that all of our starting pitchers experience some sort of  sophomore slump.  Hopefully this isn't the case.  I like to think that the Twins were careful enough with this group last year. 

Kevin Slowey gave up about 100 hits to the Blue Jays last night.  On Sunday Blackburn was cruising until the wheels fell of.  Same goes for Liriano on Saturday.  RA Dickey doesn't really count, and the offense couldn't do anything for Perkins on Thursday.  What does this all mean? Probably nothing, since its been 8 games.  However, if we can't beat teams like Seattle and Toronto, we might be in trouble.  It helps that our divisional rivals are struggling as well.

So what do you guys think?  Is there some silver lining I'm missing to these first 8 games?  At what point to we have to get worried about our pitchers? 3 starts, 4 starts, July?
