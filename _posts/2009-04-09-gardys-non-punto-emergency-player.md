Look, I know this happened two days ago and is therefore old news, but I just can't let it slide. Remember when we came back in the bottom of the ninth against the Mariners? (In quite thrilling fashion, I might add.) Well, what if we hadn't managed to take the lead, and the game had been tied going into the 10th? Recall that Kubel had pinch-hit for Morales and Buscher had pinch-hit for Punto, meaning our catcher and shortstop were out of the game. And the backup catcher, Redmond, is injured.

<a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/04/07/twins-postgame-not-one-of-these-already/">What's a manager to do?</a>
<blockquote>Mike Redmond and his pulled groin muscle was going to hobble out to the field to catch the tenth if the game had been tied. And get this: Twins manager Ron Gardenhire had told R.A. Dickey to get ready to play in the field if an emergency situation.

“Gardy told me to get my spikes on.” Dickey said. “I was going to go out there and Babe Ruth it. Yesterday, I was the bullpen coach (in place of the ill Rick Stelmaszek). Today I was going to be the right fielder (if needed). This is a heck of an organization.”</blockquote>
Well, Redmond was going to play. Because he's tough like that.

But RA Dickey, the knuckleballer who made the team because he struck out everyone he faced this spring <em>and</em> Scott Baker got injured, was going to play in the outfield.

I really enjoyed seeing the comeback and I couldn't be more pleased with the win. But is anyone else imagining the difference between Cuddyer firing a missle from RF and Dickey fluttering in a knuckleball from the warning track? Doesn't anyone else want to see that?

Also, when he calls it "a heck of an organization," I don't know if he means it in a good way, or if he meant to say "wreck." I'm going to assume the former, because I don't want to start wishing ill on an entertaining knuckleballer who happens to be on our team.
