Okay everyone, here's <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/04/02/postgame-update-baker-morneau-young-punto/">a little injury update</a> from Joe C.

First the good news:
<blockquote>Twins General Manager Bill Smith said the team is confident Scott Baker (right shoulder stiffness) will return from the 15-day disabled list after missing one or two starts.

As for Justin Morneau (sore back): “I’ve been told he should be fine for Opening Day,” Manager Ron Gardenhire said.

Delmon Young (sore right shoulder) will be back in the lineup Friday, Gardenhire added.</blockquote>
So there's not much to worry about on this front. I still don't know if Baker's injury was "real" but it sure doesn't sound serious. Of course ... let's not believe them until Baker's actually on the mound for the MLB club.

Second, the funny news:
<blockquote>Nick Punto left today’s game after he fell onto the baseball, back-side first, trying to chase a fourth-inning pop up.

“The wind was blowing, the sun was out – it wasn’t the prettiest play I’ve ever seen Punto make,” Gardenhire said. “But they told me he’ll be fine.”</blockquote>
So Punto fell down and landed on his ass, with the baseball underneath it. Man I wish I could have seen that. Stupid not-all-spring-training-games-being-on-MLB.TV. Oh well. At least he's not hurt.

And finally, <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=4037375&amp;searchName=Neyer_Rob&amp;campaign=rsssrch&amp;source=neyer_rob">something to angry up the blood</a>:
<blockquote>This looks like a down year for the Twins. If they win, it's because they've got four or five starters who keep them in most games <em>and</em> because they've got one of the best players in the majors behind the plate. Sure, Baker is <em>eligible</em> to pitch on April 12. But will he? And when he does, will he be 100 percent? And what if another starter goes down? Baker may be the first but he almost certainly won't be the last.

As for Mauer, nobody seems to know how to fix him. And again, when he's back, how good will he be?

The Twins are always operating on the margins because, with the notable exceptions of Mauer and Justin Morneau, they don't have any excellent non-pitchers (unless you count Denard Span, and I don't yet). Take away one of them and replace Baker with R.A. Dickey -- and yeah, I love the knuckleballer, but c'mon -- and you're looking at a .500 team. At best.</blockquote>
If there were <em>any</em> mainstream optimism about the Twins, Neyer could try to look like a contrarian smart guy by saying stuff like this. As it is, he's yet another guy toeing the company line regarding the Twins and how they suck*. I don't think it's all that reasonable to be <em>this</em> pessimistic about the Twins' chances, especially given that the AL Central is pretty even this season and the Twins always seem to find a way to pull ahead when it's close.

<em>* Oh, and did you know that ESPN and Baseball Prospectus have a new information and opinion (and money) sharing deal going on? I wonder how that's going to effect the anti-Twins rhetoric coming out of ESPN. Actually ... I don't wonder at all.</em>

But, again, just passing along what others are saying about the Twins. As you may have noticed, <em>none</em> of it has been good yet this offseason.
