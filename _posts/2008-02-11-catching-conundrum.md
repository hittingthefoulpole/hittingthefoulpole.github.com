Gleeman touched on this topic today, but I would like to discuss it further.  Why is Gardy so afraid of using both Redmond and Mauer in the lineup at the same time?  Why is he so scared of losing his DH?  Is having a pitcher hit that much worse than using Tyner or Rondell White?  I think it is safe to say that our best bat off the bench was Mike Redmond, so isn't having him sit on the bench instead of used as the DH a waste and detrimental to the team?  His doomsday scenario only played out once last year.  In the second game of that double header against the white sox in July.  We won. In that game Redmond got hurt in the first inning, so Gardy had to play by NL rules all game.  If memory serves we scored about 12 runs that game (after putting up over 20 in the first game), and how many times did we score in double digits all year?  Not many.  So it seems like we play better when using NL rules because nobody expects the pitcher to produce.  He usually stirkes out or can lay down a nice bunt.  Where as the White/Tyner types hit into a double play or some other very unproductive out.  I think Gardy should face his fear and just put the best lineup he can on the field without worrying about losing his DH for a few innings.  It's a long season, so maybe having to actively manage NL style every once in a while will keep him sharp.  I just hate to see the twins lose games because of Gardy's irrational fear of losing his DH.
