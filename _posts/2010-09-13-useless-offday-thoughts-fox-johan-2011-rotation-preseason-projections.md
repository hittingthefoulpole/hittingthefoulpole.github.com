Useless Offday Thoughts was my favorite ongoing feature last year at Fire Gardy, but I haven't done any this year because the Twins haven't had any days off yet. Or rather, for some other, more "real" reason, like "laziness." But it makes its triumphant return today!

## Matt Fox

When Matt Fox got the call to make a start for the Twins, I hadn't heard of him. That's no surprise, really -- his numbers in the minors are basically the definition of underwhelming. But he performed admirably (or better) with less than 24 hours notice against one of the best offenses in the league, and found out about the business side of baseball just a couple days later when he was cut to make room on the 40 man roster for Ben Revere. Gardenhire said he didn't like having to tell Fox about it, and at the time it seemed like a coldhearted thing for the Twins to do.

But there's another, more encouraging way to look at the situation. Fox took advantage of his opportunity -- and a rare opportunity it was, relying on a GM valuing the bullpen of a 49-95 AAA team more than the bullpen of a contending major league team, a long extra inning game in which both of the team's trade-acquired-closers begged out of duty, requiring _two_ starting pitchers to pitch in relief -- and made enough of an impression that another team decided to take a closer look at him; the Red Sox selected him on waivers (apparently hoping they could catch the Boof Bonser lightning in the bottle for a second time). Fox would have been a minor league free agent at the end of the season anyway, and the Twins most likely wouldn't have kept him around. It's more than possible that this series of events was the best possible outcome for Matt Fox; I hope he doesn't hold this against the Twins. (My guess is that he doesn't.)

## Johan Santana

Santana [is having season-ending shoulder surgery](http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/top-posts/johan-santana-to-have-season-ending-surgery.php) and he will apparently start "throwing" again some time next spring. "Throwing," you will note, is different from "pitching."

Back in 2007 there was a whole lot of hand wringing about losing Johan, and criticism toward the Twins organization for not "doing what it takes" to re-sign him. But the Twins did offer him a couple of massive extensions, rumored at the time to have been in the range of 5 years and $100M. The Twins _did_ attempt to over-extend themselves financially in order to keep what they saw as a "face of the franchise" type of player. However, there had already been signs that Santana's era of dominance was coming to a closer -- after posting 7.7 WAR in 2004, 7.6 WAR in 2005, and 7.3 WAR in 2006 (all three deserving of Cy Young awards but only netting him two), his production dropped to 4.6 WAR in 2007. The Twins didn't get a haul worthy of a 7-win player, but Santana earned himself a contract befitting one. And he just hasn't been worth it, so far.

The Mets got a 4.8 WAR season in 2008, followed by 2.8 WAR in 2009 and 3.7 WAR in 2010. They're paying for an elite pitcher, an Ace, and they're simply not getting one. And there's really no telling what they'll have when he returns ... this surgery is one that risks a pitcher's velocity and command. Oh yeah, there's one last thing: regardless of how well he can pitch, the Mets still owe him $77.5M over the remainder of his contract.

I know I'm working with the benefit of hindsight here, which is unfair, but imagine that Santana had accepted the Twins' offer of $20M per season. They wouldn't have received the players they used to acquire Jon Rauch or JJ Hardy, they wouldn't have had the payroll flexibility to sign Joe Mauer to his mega-contract, they may not have found themselves at the point on the win-curve where it made sense to sign Orlando Hudson or Jim Thome (and they may not have been able to afford it), or to trade for Matt Capps or Brian Fuentes. For all that, they would have received a Johan Santana in name only -- good, not great performance -- at the cost of the best pitcher in the game. To compare: Carl Pavano has been worth 3.6 WAR this season, roughly the same as Santana. And in 2010, _Livan Hernandez_ has been worth 2.8 WAR.

Suffice it to say, things would have been _a little bit different_ if the Twins had signed Johan rather than traded him. It just goes to show you, signing pitchers to long-term contracts is _extremely dangerous_.

## 2011 Rotation

The Twins' starting rotation hasn't seemed like a strong suit this year, and the unit's 4.10 ERA has been the 6th-best in the AL this year. But what might the rotation look like next season? Will it still need to be bolstered by a strong offense?

Francisco Liriano has posted 6.1 WAR this season, good for 3rd-best in the majors and _1st-best_ in the AL. I'm not here to argue, again, that he's an Ace, or that he's been the best pitcher in the league this season, even though those things may well be true. I'm also not here to gloat that I picked him to win the AL Cy Young award this year, even though that's certainly true. (He obviously _won't_ win the Cy Young, but if he leads the league in WAR he certainly earned the right to be in the conversation.) My only point here is that he's pretty good and will headline the rotation next season.

Pavano has pitched way above his paygrade, and may have earned a multi-year contract somewhere. Given the Twins' payroll status -- which appears to be shooting well about $100M -- he probably won't earn his dollars in Minnesota. I'm sure there will be a contingent of fans disappointed by that, but it seems likely at this point unless Pavano (for some reason) decides that he likes Minnesota enough to sign another one-year, below-market-rate contract. I find that a little unlikely.

So there are likely four spots open behind Liriano -- Baker and Blackburn may have had disappointing seasons this year, but they also have guaranteed contracts, so they'll be in the rotation. Competing for the final two spots: Kevin Slowey, Brian Duensing, Glen Perkins, Jeff Manship, Anthony Swarzak, and Alex Burnett. Promising prospects David Bromberg, and Kyle Gibson will probably not be in the competition at the start of the season, but may be ready to play a role sometime in 2011.

From where I sit, Slowey and Duensing are most likely to get the call to start the year, with the rest of those middling names will fill out the team's necessary pitching depth. The rotation actually seems like it's in reasonably good shape ... how likely do you think it is that the Twins feel the need to look to the free agent market either to make a splash with a big name or to pick up a veteran retread to lose some games before getting cut in July?

## PECOTA

I always like to make jokes about Baseball Prospectus' PECOTA projection system having some sort of robotic vendetta against the Twins, but at this point it seems that the AL Central might just reside in some sort of computerized black hole where PECOTA's systems can't see it. For 2010, [they projected the Twins to win the AL Central with just 83 wins](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/336171-2010-pecota-projections-the-winners), and no other AL Central team was projected to best a .500 record.

That projection seemed foolish to me at the time -- it ignored the tremendous offense built around stars like Mauer and Morneau, and filled out with capable players at every position and must have assumed that none of the pitchers could get anyone out, and perhaps most importantly it demonstrated that the computer has _not_ become sentient. After all, PECOTA always projects the Twins to be roughly a .500 team, and it always turns out to be wrong. Maybe that's evidence of an anti-Twins bias in the computer algorithms developed by people who live on the South Side of Chicago and frequently attend White Sox games. Maybe it's evidence that Ron Gardenhire is actually an excellent manager who consistently ekes more wins out of his roster than he ought to be able to. Maybe the Twins franchise has just been stupidly lucky every single year; I live in Chicago, and that seems to be the prevailing notion here.

Regardless, the Twins have already won 85 games this year and are on pace to win 96 games -- that beats PECOTA's projection so handily that I wish I had the graphics-making chops to throw together an image of Gardy taking a shit on a computer.

...

These were certainly useless. I hope it wasn't too much of a stretch to call them thoughts. Something to help get you through an offday.
