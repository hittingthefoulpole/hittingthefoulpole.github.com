Game one of the Twins-Tigers doubleheader will start at 11am central time today.  Since I am at work I will only be following the gamecast, but feel free to follow me (@Robert_Short) and sirsean (@sirsean) on twitter to read any thoughts we have on the game.

Blackburn vs Procello.  The Twins need to win this game to set the tone.  As all of you have read the Twins need to win at least 3.  Do that and we are tied heading into a weekend series at the dome against KC, while the Tigers play the white sox in Detroit.  If we win all 4 we will have a commanding 2 game lead with 3 to play.  Let's not get ahead of ourselves, one game at a time, etc. etc. 

Go Twins!
