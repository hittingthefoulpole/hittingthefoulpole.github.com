The Twins signed Jason Kubel to a two year deal, with a team option for a third year.  Some <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/twins-sign-kubel-why">people</a>question this move, since he is already under team control for the next two years.  It really only gives the team cost certainty.  I think its a team friendly deal, mainly because of the option.  It can't hurt to have a useful bat locked it for two to three years.  One of the reasons this move does look questionable is because of the outfield/DH logjam.  Kubel had to fight for at bats last year, now Michael Cuddyer is added to the mix and he will have to fight even harder.  It appears that no washed up free agent will steal his ABs, but perhaps a nearly washed up never-was will.  Ideally Gardy rotates Young-Span-Gomez-Cuddyer through the 3 OF spots, and lets Kubel be as the primary DH.  Possibly using Cuddyer against especially tough lefties.  Depth never hurt anyone. 

The dollar amount for Kubel's deal doesn't bother me, we either pay him 7 mil for 2 years, or 12 mil for 3 years, I think.  Not bad, especially if he has a killer first two years.  Will this new deal force Gardy to give Kubel more at bats?  Will the return of Cuddyer take at bats away? If we are facing a right handed pitcher, there is no question Kubel should be the DH.  Should be interesting to see how this plays out.  I highly doubt any of the five players mentioned above are moved before the start of the season, so Gardy better figure something out.
