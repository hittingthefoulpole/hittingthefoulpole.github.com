Around the beginning of September, Denard Span felt the need to shake things up. He's had a rough year, and especially since the All Star break he'd been struggling.

From the All Star break to September 2, Span had more strikeouts than walks, only 7 extra base hits in 199 plate appearances, a paltry 7 RBI, and 4 stolen bases against 3 times caught stealing (plus countless times "picked off," which don't count as a caught-stealing for whatever reason). His triple-slash for that period was .244/.306/.283, for a .589 OPS ... which is about what you'd expect to get from your backup CF at AAA. These were not good times.

Span has long been one of the "new school" players who prefers full-length pants, with the hem down below his ankles. Objectively, I guess, it looks less stupid that way than the shorter pants with high socks. But given that there are only so many things you can do to "shake things up," Denard decided to wear his socks high and see how it felt.

He went 2-4 with a double on September 3. Wearing his socks up felt good.

Span tweeted that the next morning. That day, he went 2-4 again, with a walk. After that series with the Rangers, Span must have found himself at a crossroads: go back to the long pants that he's more comfortable with, or stick with the shorter pants that he's hitting well in?

In baseball, goofy stuff like how you wear your pants matters. Apparent nonsense about "respecting the streak," and what not, but the point is that if Span thinks he can play better with his socks high, then, well, he can play better with his socks high. That's one of the oldest truths of baseball.

Plus, it makes you look more like a baseball player. At least, I think so.

So far, Span has listened. (Or, more likely, has decided to respect the streak, as I'm guessing he doesn't actually listen to random dudes who tweet things at him.)

Since then he's worn his socks high every game, and in 49 plate appearances he's walked the same number of times as he's struck out, he has an impressive 10 RBI, he has 3 steals and hasn't been caught stealing (and I don't recall any pickoffs); he's hitting .286/.354/.429, for a .783 OPS which is pretty close to the sort of performance that got him his contract in the first place.

Keep your socks up, Denard!
