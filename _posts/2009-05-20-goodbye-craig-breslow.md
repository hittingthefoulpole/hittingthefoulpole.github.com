The Twins cut Craig Breslow today (he was claimed by Oakland), and <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/05/20/twins-shake-up-the-bullpen-a-little-more/">promoted righthander Anthony Swarzak</a>.  <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=paI04016&amp;position=P">Swarzak</a> will start on Saturday against the Brewers in place of the injured Perkins.  Speaking of Perkins, it sounds like nothing is seriously wrong and he should be good to go when his 15 days are up.  The only problem I have with this is as follows: Does that mean his inability to get guys out the last few starts was due to general suckiness and not an injury?

I like the Breslow move.  The current bullpen clearly wasn't working so changes had to be made.  It looks like someone did go to jail, or in this case Oakland.  Which is basically the same thing.

Thats all for today.  Liriano goes tonight looking to snap the five game losing streak we are currently on.  Is anyone else's mouth drooling at the thought of playing the delicious NL soon?
