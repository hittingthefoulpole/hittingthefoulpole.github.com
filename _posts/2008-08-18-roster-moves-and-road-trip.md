With Casilla due back later this week, Gardy will have some interesting decisions to make when constructing his lineups for the rest of the season.  I'm assuming Casilla will become the everyday second baseman, and Gardy has said "Nicky will be in the mix at short". Great, we will be rotating between Adam Everett and Nick Punto as our starting SS. That is just terrible. At least with Casilla coming back we won't have a black hole in the number 2 spot anymore.  It looks like Harris will be the odd man out, and only get playing time at third base against lefties. This makes Mike Lamb even more of the odd man out because he will probably never play.

In order to clear a spot for Casilla on the roster who will get sent down? My money is on Ruiz because I feel that Gardy uses "last in first out" logic when sending people down.  Do we have any outfielders on the bench. Assuming Kubel is the DH, the answer is no. Will Nick Punto see time in the OF if one of Span-Gomez-Young gets hurt, ejected, (or killed, remember we are going to oakland)?  Or will Gardy revert to his fear of losing the DH and keep Kubel on the bench to have a spare outfielder?  I guess this is only a problem for a few weeks because rosters expand on Sept 1.  However, playoff rosters are locked in on Aug 31 I believe. So if we make the playoffs (knock on wood) will we do it with only three oufielders, with the 4th being our starting DH?  This all also assumes Cuddyer will not come back from his foot injury, or if he does he won't be effective.  If he does come back and is useful, there won't be a real problem. 

This road trip coming will really show if we are a real contender. If we play the LA like we did seattle, we will lose.  We basically need our starters to go 7-8 innings because outside of Nathan, I don't trust anyone in the bullpen.  Is the front office going to try to get to the roster expansion date without making any moves (and by moves I mean call up Bobby Korecky)?  I think that would be a mistake. I say when Casilla comes back, cut Bass loose and bring up Korecky.  I don't think there is anyway we don't send down Ruiz to clear a spot for Casilla, I don't agree with it but I'm sure that is the move they are going to make.  I for one would like to get rid of Lamb, but the twins seem to live by the policy "If we are paying him, he stays on the team. Not matter how terrible he is". 

What moves does everyone think need to be made to sruvive the last month and a half of this season?
