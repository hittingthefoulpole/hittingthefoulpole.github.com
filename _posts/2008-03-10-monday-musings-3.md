Friend of FireGardy.com, Grizz, will be making the trek down to spring training in a few days.  I doubt he and his band of merry men will have access to a computer, so I will make attempts to talk to them via telephone and update the site that way.  Also, I will be trying to convice them to take a tire iron to Nick Punto's head.  Or to Gardy's for playing him so damn much.

Has anyone else been as disappointed with Brendan Harris as I have.  I mean, I though he was going to be the clear cut starter at second, basically handed the job.  However, he has played like garbage, Punto is still Punto, and Casilla has played very well.  You'd think this would be a no-brainer, give the job to Casilla.  But no.  Gardy will make this hard.  As has been discussed in this space before, Gardy loves guys who can "catch the ball" and everything else is just gravy. No! Baseball has many aspects.  Let's say we have 3, to keep it simple: hitting, fielding, baserunning.  Punto is well below average at hitting, below average at baserunning, and average (at best) at fielding.  So overall that makes him a below average player.  Is Gardy ignoring two thirds of the game here?  Possibly more if you were to break hitting down into more categories (average, power, eye, etc.).  This is just not good.  I really expected Harris to come in and take the job from day 1, thus making Gardy's decision for him. He didn't do this, so now Gardy must actually make a managerial decision, and he isn't good at that.
