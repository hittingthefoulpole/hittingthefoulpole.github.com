"I think Gardy may have just been saying stuff," Cuddyer said with a laugh during the press conference. "But I'm up for any challenge if that comes my way. I've never shied away from playing any position. If that does come about, I'll go out and play my best."

Gardy may have "<a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080126&amp;content_id=2356066&amp;vkey=news_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min">just been saying stuff</a>" when he brought up the possibility of Cuddyer in CF? How often does this happen? And if this is common, do the players listen to it? After all, Gardy's in charge. When he talks, the players are supposed to listen.

So when he's "just saying stuff" like "Let's play Punto every day, we don't need to score to win," it happens. Punto plays, we lose, and people <em>laugh</em> about Gardy's antics.

Frankly, his decisions and statements are laughable. And unforgivable. At least Cuddyer doesn't take him too seriously.
