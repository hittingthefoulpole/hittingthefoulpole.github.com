Mauer's health is clearly becoming a major national issue, as <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3979724&amp;searchName=olney_buster&amp;campaign=rsssrch&amp;source=olney_buster">Buster Olney has written about him for the second consecutive day</a>. There's really nothing new until the results of his second opinion today in Baltimore go public. But there are a few interesting bits of information here.

The first is that <a href="http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_11883079">Charley Walters has printed some unsubstantiated information</a> that would be quite promising if it's true:

<span id="default">
<blockquote>The sore back that has kept Twins catcher Joe Mauer from playing in spring training games could put contract extension talks on hold for the all-star and two-time batting champion, who can become a free agent after the 2010 season.

Extension talks were to have begun soon in Fort Myers, Fla. Mauer's contract status likely won't be affected, though, if he's playing well in 2010.</blockquote>
I don't believe I'd read anywhere that contract talks were actually expected to start this spring -- just that everyone desperately wants them to. Either Walters is jumping the gun on some wishful thinking here, or he's got better information than everyone else. Either way, given Mauer's injury and the fact that the Twins aren't about to give a long-term extension to a currently-injured player (nor would that player sign a discounted extension before getting the opportunity to play and drive his price up), it's immaterial.

So we're probably going to have to wait until next winter to sign Mauer to his big extension.

And the second tidbit we got from Olney is Cuddyer's thoughts on Mauer and his value to the team:
<blockquote>Mauer is extremely important to us. Not only because he is a great hitter who compliments our lineup like nobody else can, but because of the force that he is behind the plate. Here with the Twins, we have to put a lot of emphasis on keeping runners from crossing the plate. That means not allowing them to get into scoring position, and with him behind the plate, runners tend to stay at their respective base and not get that urge to steal. Which in turn keeps teams from scoring easily. â€¦ As far as our concern level, obviously we still have some time this spring, but the days are getting less and less, so it is definitely a concern for us. In that same sense, we all trust Joe to do what he needs to do to get ready because we need him healthy, especially at the position he plays.</blockquote>
Yesterday I -- shall we say -- criticized Gardy for not being particularly articulate when describing Mauer's value to the team. Olney must not have been satisfied either, and decided to seek out a better quote from a more articulate guy connected to the team. And, as usual, Cuddyer doesn't disappoint.

Focusing on Mauer's ability to control the running game probably understates Mauer's overall value to the team, and overstates the value of preventing steals for a team filled with homer-prone pitchers. (Stealing second makes it easier to score -- but if the hitter puts one over the fence it doesn't really matter, does it?) But there's no doubt that Cuddyer's response is more thought out than Gardy's was.

But it's also clear that the level of concern over Mauer's health is increasing rapidly as Opening Day starts to loom closer. And it leaves me thinking I might have to adjust my blase "he's fine, nothing to worry about" attitude.

I'll keep my eyes open for updates. Watch this space -- and the #firegardy Twitter feed at the top of the page -- for updates.
