<a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080122&amp;content_id=2352684&amp;vkey=news_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min">Gardy has floated the idea of playing Cuddyer </a>in center. This is bad for many reasons, I will highlight a few.

1) Cuddyer has spent two years learning how to play the wall in right, so why move him thus having a sub-par defender in center and right.

2) Cuddyer does not have the range or athleticism to cover center.

3) Moving Cuddyer to center and having Young and Kubel at the corners makes for a rough looking outfield.

I'm sure we will see Punto take a fair amount of reps in center during spring training.  This will not be pretty.  Gardy will take every chance he can get to give his boyfriend some ABs.  This will not translate into wins.
