Last week, a rumor about <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090202&amp;content_id=3792418&amp;vkey=news_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min&amp;partnerId=rss_min">signing Scott Baker to a long term contract</a> came and went without much fanfare.
<blockquote>"I have definitely entertained the idea of it." Baker said recently of a possible multi-year deal. "I like this place. I like playing here. I like the coaching staff and obviously we have a great clubhouse. It's kind of up to them, but I definitely have thought about it."</blockquote>
Okay, it's up to the Twins. Would they do something like that?
<blockquote>"Historically, we've done deals with players as they get to two, three and four years of service time," Antony said. "And I think that's something we'll continue to do."</blockquote>
Yes, they have. Morneau, Kubel, Mauer, Santana, Crain. But would Scott Baker be worth a long term deal right now? They say that the last year before they hit arbitration is the best year to ink them to a deal, so you can buy out their arbitration years and give them some security when they had none, but before they're sniffing free agency just around the corner. That's where Baker is right now, so let's see what a contract would look like.

In 2007, Baker's free market value was $11.7M, and in 2008 it was $15.4M. That's what a pitcher who consistently puts up good numbers is worth. (And I'm looking at FIP here, not W and ERA which are much more dependent on teammates.) His 2007 FIP was 3.89; in 2008 it was 3.79. His numbers are consistent, and good. So let's say his market value is somewhere between 2007 and 2008, and stays there until he's 30 (three years from now), at which point he will start to decline at a typical rate of 10% per year.

So his market values for the next four years, let's say, are $12M, $12M, $12M, $10.8M. That is absolutely <em>not</em>Â the contract we should give him; that's what we would pay if these weren't his arbitration years. The general guideline for arbitration salaries is that they are an increasing percentage of the player's market value: 20%/40%/80% or 40%/60%/80% in the three arbitration years. When signing a player through his last pre-arbitration years, some teams get 20/20/40/80, others get 20/40/60/80 or something along those lines.

If the Twins got a team-friendly 20/20/40/80 contract, Baker's yearly salary would be $2.4M, $2.4M, $4.8M, $8.6M. If it were the more player-friendly 20/40/60/80 deal, his contract would look like $2.4M, $4.8M, $7.2M, $8.6M. So we're probably looking at something in the range between 4/$18M and 4/$23M for a fair deal. Toss one or two $10-12M team options on the end with $2-3M buyouts, and you've probably got yourself a deal.

The problem with doing this for the Twins is:
<ol>
	<li>Baker could get hurt.</li>
	<li>This is what they'd be paying him if he doesn't improve from where he is, so why give him the long term deal?</li>
	<li>Security breeds lack of motivation in some cases.</li>
</ol>
If Baker continues to improve as a pitcher, he'll earn more than $23M over his arbitration years. If he gets hurt or craps out, he gets nothing. The security of $20M would probably be enough to get him to sign the deal and help out the team.

I think the Twins should get this done and lock up the most consistent pitcher on the team through his arbitration years. Not only would it probably help the team and have minimal downside (Baker does not have an injury history and has a simple, non-violent delivery), but it would send the right message to the fans and the players.

What do you think about a possible Baker extension?
