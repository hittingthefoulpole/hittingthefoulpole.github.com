A few thoughts on things I've read now that camp has opened.
<ul>
	<li>Livan Hernandez was told not to wear "bling-blings" in the words of Gardy.  I did not know this but team rules state no excessive jewelry can be worn by players.  I have no problem with this, but it might also explain why we have lots of dorky white guys on the team.  Livan was also told he could not wear a windbreaker during practice.  I thought this was strange.  At least he isn't like Wild Thing Rick Vaugh and not wearing a cap or sleeves.</li>
	<li>The team seems to be plagued by visa problems.  First Liriano and his DUI related issue.  Now we have Reyes who just plain forgot to renew his passport, so he is stuck in Mexico until later this week.  Casilla also missed his visa renewal appointment due to a family emergency.  I guess that is ok, but he is one guy who really can't afford to miss workouts. </li>
	<li>Carlos Gomez appears to be "head and shoulders" above the competition for the starting CF job.  This does not surprise me, as Span is just plain bad and should not be considered, but I think Pridie should be given a fair shake.  Either way it should be fun to watch, or read about.</li>
	<li>Back to Livan, apparently he had some trouble keeping up with the other pitchers during wind sprints yesterday.  Granted it is the first day, he is fat, and Reyes wasn't there to make him look good, but for a guy who was desperate to get a job he should have showed up to camp in a little better shape.  Maybe his presence is why people think Boof looks so slim.</li>
</ul>
