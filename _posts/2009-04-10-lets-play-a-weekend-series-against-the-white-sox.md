Yesterday my entire day was stopped cold upon learning about the Adenhart tragedy. I'm not one for heartfelt words that make one feel better or put their lives in perspective, or anything like that, so I'm just going to try to move on and attempt to use baseball as an escape from life's harsh realities. And I'm not even going to pull a Joe Sheehan and say something like that and then say something heartfelt that helps put things in perspective. I'm really not.

So, let's just try to get things going today.

The Twins are coming to Chicago to face the White Sox, which means three things:
<ol>
	<li>I will not be able to watch the game on MLB.TV, since it's be on Comcast Sports Net here in Chicago</li>
	<li>Thus, I will not be able to choose the broadcast, and will be stuck with the infinitely annoying Hawk Harrelson*</li>
	<li>RA Dickey will be on the mound tonight, which should be extremely interesting in the windy weather we've got going down here today</li>
</ol>
If you think the Twins' offense looked miserable this week against what wasn't supposed to be a great Mariners pitching staff, the White Sox looked even worse against an even worse Royals staff. Both teams will be looking to get their offenses back on track, as well as hoping for some better pitching (though the Twins are more in need of that than are the Sox at the moment).

<em>* My only hope in the event of a (probably inevitable) home run is that the fireworks that'll launch right down the street from me manage to drown out Hawk's unbearable home run call. It's happened before ... though sometimes the TV feed is delayed long enough that I hear the fireworks before I see the home run. Believe me, that's disheartening.</em>

This isn't a newspaper, so I don't need to attempt to invent storylines like "Game 163 Revisited" or anything lame like that. The important thing is that this is a big rivalry series and we need to win these games. We need to take two of the games this weekend, and <em>not</em>Â allow the White Sox to bounce back from their opening week woes (which appears to be the wont of the Twins over the last several years).

Go Twins.
