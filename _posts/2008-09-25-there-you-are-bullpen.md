We've missed you.

I'm not going to lie, I was pretty nervous every inning of this game, especially when the ones that featured Breslow, Bonser, and Mirajes.  Good thing each of them didn't last long (innings that is, not pitchers).  I thought Blackburn did a great job pitching out of jams, granted he got himself into those jams but its a good sign that he doesn't lose focus and just gets guys out.  You can't blame the guy for giving up a homer to Junior, he is probably the greatest hitter of our generation.

I don't think its possible to stress how much those four near perfect innings of relief were.  The combination of Breslow, Bonser, and Mijares gave up a total of one hit and one walk in four innings.  That is pretty damn impressive considering just how bad the relief corps has been of late.  Blackburn just didn't seem to have his best stuff but he still managed to get through five innings and only give up two runs to this powerful White Sox lineup. Ken Griffey, Jr. was responsible for both of them.  I think the bullpen appreciated that effort by Blackburn and decided to pick him up and make sure he got the win. Now, if I find out that the bullpen has been deciding when they want to pitch well, and when they want to pitch poorly I will kill them all.

On the offensive side of the ball the Twins were pretty boring but did what they needed to do.  Outside of Gomez we only struck out twice (Gomez struck out 3 times, I think we should start calling him Karlos).  We drew four walks and positioned ourselves on the bases so we could score two of our runs on outs. Both fielders choices (i have no idea if both of those should be plural) by Joe Mauer.

Nathan made it interesting, but with the help of Karlos his linescore looks like he just allowed one harmless walk. Instead of nearly giving up a double to AJ that was catch-able by one center fielder in baseball, and throwing twenty pitches, only ten of them for strikes.  I'm starting to notice some Mark Fidrych tendencies in Nathan, hopefully that doesn't lead to full blown craziness.

Tonight is the surgeon Kevin Slowey, Amy Nelson has a good<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3607999"> piece</a> about the Twins young pitchers, especially Slowey on ESPN.com. I really like how we bookended this series with Baker and Slowey, in my opinion they are our two best starters, 1a and 1b if you will. Enjoy the game tonight. Any predictions on the lineup Gardy puts out there? I think you have to stick with the normal lineup versus righties. Buscher at third, Kubel DHing. Thoughts?
