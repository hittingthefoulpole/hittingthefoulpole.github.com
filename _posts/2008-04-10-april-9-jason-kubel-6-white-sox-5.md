It was nice to see the lineup produce against a lefty today. For as long as I can remember the Twins have just flat out sucked against left handed pitching. I was unable to watch all of the game because I had my attention on the Wild-Colorado game.  I watched the first few innings and it looked like Danks just didn't have it and we took advantage. Gomez drawing a walk was a nice touch, although he then got picked off. Danks did seem to have a nice pickoff move, and I think Gomez hasn't mastered the art of reading a pitcher's pickoff move yet. Hunter was really good at that.

I didn't see Kubel's grand slam, but he came up to the plate with the bases loaded something like 3 times.  Baker looked OK, there are worse ways to give up 3 runs than 3 solo jacks. Brian Bass, still terrible.

Can someone explain to me all the position swtiching that took place. Harris moved to first after Lamb moved over there? Then Punto came in at second? The box score doesn't really help explain what went down.

Gardy on Kubel:
<blockquote>"I really believe this guy can hit," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He's going to get plenty of opportunities this year. ... I think he's healthy in his knees now, we don't hear about that anymore, and now it's time for him to get the at-bats and go. Run with it."--from espn.com recap.</blockquote>
 Let's hope he holds true to his word.
