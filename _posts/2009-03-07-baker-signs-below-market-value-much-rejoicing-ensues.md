Good news, everyone!

The Twins have locked up their most consistent pitcher on a long term deal. <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/03/07/twins-sign-baker-to-four-year-deal/">Scott Baker will make $15.25M</a> over the next four years (we bought out his arbitration years), and the Twins hold a $9.25M option for a fifth year (which would have been his first of free agency).

My <a href="http://firegardy.com/2009/02/06/time-to-extend-baker/">analysis of Baker's value</a> recommended that we should definitely sign him, and I calculated his value as somewhere between 4/$18M and 4/$23M, and that we should add a $10-12M option for a fifth year. The Twins will end up paying less that what I figured was the minimum we could get him for.

I suppose that just means Baker and his agent should spend more time reading The Internet. Where FireGardy.com, the bloggingest blog of blogs, is.

Another possibility is that Baker was willing to give a slight discount given the fact that he likes the Twins and likes being here -- as demonstrated by quotes like "I  like this place. I like playing here. I like the coaching staff and obviously we have a great clubhouse." -- and unlike pre-contract-Nathan, Santana, and Hunter, is able to realize that the Twins <em>do</em> have a limited amount of money, and if they spend a little less on you, they can spend a little more on someone else.

And today, Baker went 4 IP against the Pirates, giving up just 1 run (on a HR to Adam LaRoche) while striking out 4 and walking none.

It's a great day.
