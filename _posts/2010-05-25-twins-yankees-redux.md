The Yankees come to town tonight for a three game series.  The Twins will send Baker, Liriano and Blackburn to the mound, while the Yanks counter with Burnett, Pettitie, and Vazquez. 

In an ideal world, the Twins will take two of three, giving us a season split with New York.  Hopefully the momentum from the Brewers series will carry over.  Being at home obviously helps, so I don't think taking two of the three games is a very tall order at all.  Unfortunately, the Yankees are not just another opponent.  As I mentioned two weeks ago, there is a "Yankee stigma".  However, for the first time in a long time we can come into a game against the Yankees and say "We beat them the last time we played them".  I think this will help counteract the usual negative mindset Twins players (and coaches) seem to have going into every Yankee game.

What do you guys think the outcome of this series will be?  What, if anything, does it NEED to be?
