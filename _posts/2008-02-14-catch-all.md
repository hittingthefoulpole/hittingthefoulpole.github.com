After yesterday's discussion, it really sounds like there is no clear-cut best choice for CF.  Every option has almost equal weighted pros and cons.  This is unfortunate because Gardy can't be trusted with difficult, season altering decisions.  He is also prone to changing his mind too quickly.  If he decides to put Pridie in CF, and could yank him after a few bad ABs and plug Monroe in there, even if Monroe took zero reps in CF during Spring Training.  He tries to cover up a bad decision with another bad decision, and it ends up spiraling out of control.

Note: There will be no Roger Clemens/Steroids discussions in this space. Ever.
