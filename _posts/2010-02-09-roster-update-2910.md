The Twins <a href="http://">signed Jacque Jones</a>to a minor league deal today.  They also cut ties with Jason Pridie, to make room on the 40 man for Orlando Hudson. This is an odd move since Pridie projected to make the team as a backup OF, and Jones hasn't played in the majors since 08. Oh well, no big loss.  Speedy outfielders who can't hit are pretty easy to find on the scrap heap, so I'm sure the Twins will find some cheap player who can fill in at all 3 OF spots and pinch run occasionally.

Does anyone have Jason Tyner's number?
