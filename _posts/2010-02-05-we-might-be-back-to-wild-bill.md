Lately I've been feeling optimistic about the upcoming season, to the point of worrying that I'm over-optimistic. But I sure don't _feel_ like I'm exaggerating Bill Smith's job this offseason.

So when someone like [Dave Cameron raves about the offseason and the team in general](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/hudson-and-the-twins) -- calling them clearly the class of the division with a chance at a superb rotation -- it makes me a little less concerned about how excited I am, and how impressed I am with Smith.

> With Hudson, Hardy, and Thome, the Twins have improved their offense significantly. By retaining Pavano and watching Francisco Liriano return to form in winter ball, their pitching rotation has the chance to be among the best in baseball. Their bullpen is still good, anchored by a relief ace and some quality arms in front of him.

> It’s hard to imagine the Twins could have had a better winter. They used this off-season to upgrade the team, and while the roster isn’t perfect, they are clearly the class of the AL Central at this point. Adding Hudson is just the cherry on top of what was already a very good winter.

Wow. I think I'm going to have to go back to calling him Wild Bill.
