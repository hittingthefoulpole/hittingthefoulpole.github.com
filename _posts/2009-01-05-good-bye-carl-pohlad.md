This afternoon, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/37106499.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aU1E::Dy_oacyKU">Carl Pohlad died</a>. He was 93 years old.

I've had my differences with Pohlad over the years. And while he was the owner of the Twins, it was always very easy to villainize him. Demanding interest from the state on an $80 million "gift," threatening to sell the team to a North Carolina businessman, attempting to contract the team, refusing to increase payroll despite being the wealthiest owner in baseball, building his fortune by foreclosing on people's farms during the Great Depression (which hits the heartstrings particularly hard these days), and a history of shady business deals on which he always seems to come out ahead are all reasons Pohlad's been the butt of many angry jokes over the years.

But now is most certainly not the time to focus on those things. Despite all the threats, Pohlad kept the team in Minnesota throughout the dark years of the 1990s. He signed Kent Hrbek to the largest contract in baseball history, and Kirby Puckett to the largest contract ever offered to an outfielder, just to keep them with the Twins (that both contracts were superseded immediately is unimportant). He stayed out of the way enough for Terry Ryan to rebuild the franchise to its current level of perpetual quality -- notice that most owners demand either short-sighted moves that hurt the team in the long run, or payroll-slashing moves that hurt the team even more. And he won two World Series championships in his tenure as owner.

He finally managed to win a new stadium, and the greatest tragedy of his life is that he won't live to see it.

Today is a dark day for Twins fans, and I'm sad to see Pohlad go. The future is uncertain -- will his sons take over in Steinbrenner-like fashion? If they do, will they spend their father's money more freely, or will they be more spendthrift? If they don't, who will buy the team <em>now</em>, when big money is hard to come by -- and will the team stay in Minnesota? I'm hoping for status quo or better, but without Carl around things just might get worse.

But there are a couple things that give me hope.

The first is that Pohlad's sons work for the Twins, and one of them has been groomed for many years to take over the team. All three of his sons have been taking more control of the team as Pohlad has aged rapidly in the last decade. That points to status quo.

The second is a statement from son Robert Pohlad:
<blockquote>"My dad started with nothing, worked very hard and has been tremendously successful. I think he truly believes that if he doesn't work hard, he's gonna be back on a food line or a bread line ... looking for his next meal.''</blockquote>
That's a pretty typical mindset for people of that generation; it's the generation of packrats, constantly in fear that their life will plunge back to those terrible days and they'll have nothing. It makes sense ... and it also makes sense that people who grew up in subsequent generations would not share those same fears.

His sons grew up in said subsequent generations, during the boom years of the second half of the 20th century; they've seen recessions and bouncebacks, they've seen that the economy rebounds every time, and most of all, they've always had money. Lots of money. They've seen their father make money faster than he could possibly spend it, and they've seen his fortune grow to the 100th largest in America.

It's more than possible that his sons recognize the fact that they're not taking it with them, that the fortune will last long enough to pass on to their own children, and their children's children, in perpetuity. Payroll could easily go up, rising above the 52% of revenue limit. It's something to hope for; a little upside, as it were.

So rest in peace, Carl Pohlad. Your time in Minnesota was a good one, and you will be missed. Thanks for all the good times, and good teams.

And condolences to the Pohlad family. Follow in your father's footsteps -- keep the team in Minnesota and in the family. But don't be afraid to step a few feet from the tree, and spend a few bucks. (It'll help you get respect from the fans while you're still alive.)

Go Twins. The team will outlast us all. That's the ultimate hope of every fan.
