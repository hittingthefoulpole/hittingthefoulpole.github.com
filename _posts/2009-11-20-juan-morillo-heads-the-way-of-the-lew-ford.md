Juan Morillo and Justin Huber have both <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/bb/6725250.html">signed </a>with the Hiroshima Carp of the Japanese League.

This isn't a very big loss.  Morillo could throw really, really hard, but that's about it.  During his time with the twins in 2009 he didn't show much progess in his ability to harness the fastball. It would have been nice to keep him around and see if the minor league instructors could work with him, but I'm glad the Twins didn't bend over backwards to keep him.  That would have been foolish.  But hey, the team is going to make at least one foolish decision this offseason, so here's to Bill Smith trying to keep them at a minimum.

Justin Huber was a very average player.  He had a decent minor league track record, but no real position.  He will probably have some success in Japan, due to the moderate power he flashed in the minors.  I wish them both the best of luck overseas.
