_We can put men on base._

The Twins have had a lot of baserunners this year, seemingly able to load the bases at will; often doing it multiple times per game. Again and again, they put a man on third with fewer than two outs. They've given themselves many, many opportunities to score.

_The next guy still has a chance to drive these runs in._

This nearly-constant flow of baserunners, this ongoing, apparently unstoppable stream of hits and walks, has led many people -- myself included -- to simply expect that at some point, the runs **must** come. The ability to get on base is the key to a good offense, and the Twins have been near the league lead in walks all season, led by Morneau's otherworldly OBP pushing .500; and they are scoring runs, finding themselves among the league leaders in runs scored.

_We're not hitting homers, what if we don't start? What if the runs don't come?_

But they lead the league in men left of on base, and they lead the league in team GIDP. Those are things that grind on you, as a fan. With every burgeoning rally wiped out by another taylor-made grounder to short, your shoulders slump a little more. As it goes, you start expecting these bums to fail.

It's like in that Simpsons episode, Dancin' Homer, when the Isotopes are down to their final out and need a bit hit, the announcer says "And, after he pops out, we'll go straight to the postgame." 

_With all these rallies getting snuffed out, we need to come through with a big hit. Big swing here._

Over the first several weeks of the season, I've been preaching a very patient approach to the Twins' struggles with men on base. It's pretty likely there are people -- even those who would agree that the Twins' performance with the bases occupied is _bound_ to improve at some point -- who would say I've been too adamant in my stance that there's really nothing to worry about. That if we just keep waiting, the runs will come.

_Nuts, got under it. Crap, topped that one to short. Swinging too hard?_

The thing is, this is the kind of thing that can dwell in your mind. It can nag at you. And the nagging gets loudest when you find yourself in the biggest, most important spots of the game. That's when the doubt sets in most.

_Another inning-ending double play. Of course._

Now, I have a question. You see all those italics up there? I've thought every one of those things, during many games this season. Sometimes I tweeted it, sometimes I texted Robert, sometimes I mentioned it to my dad on Skype, and sometimes I'd just keep it to myself. Probably most of the time I kept it to myself; after all, you're supposed to take it easy with these minor, individual events. Millions of them happen over the course of a long season, and some go your way and some don't, and you don't want to be too annoying. I don't, anyway. I don't know how successful I am, though.

Anyhow, I imagine a _lot_ of people have shared those thoughts, and have felt that same doubt. I know that some people have, because I've argued against them plenty.

My main fear is that some of the people who're thinking those poisonous italic sentences happen to be in the dugout. That the players share my doubts; that would change _everything_. Players aren't supposed to suffer those doubts, they're not supposed to worry the same way a fan does. If they are, we're in trouble. More importantly, they have to stop before they can start hitting.

When I tell myself it's okay to relax and expect the runs to come, in a big way I'm expecting that the players aren't worried about it, that they're able to put these individual micro-events of the baseball season behind them. That's their job. It's part of being a baseball player. But ... am I believing in them too much?

When individual players have a slump, they say in interviews (long after the slump is over) that it can drive you crazy, and you can start subconsciously tweaking your mechanics, and you get even more out of whack, and before you know it the slump has taken on a life of its own. You've created a monster. After so much time, it's conceivable that such a thing may be able to effect an entire team at once -- and if so, the symptoms would look an awful lot like the Twins' recent foibles.

I'm talking about something kind of fuzzy here, so I hope you'll forgive me if I go a little anecdotal here. Here are some normally-minor events from Wednesday night's game:

1. Cuddyer finally batted with nobody on in front of him, and he connected on one and drove a double deep to right center. Standing on second base, he was smiling, like a weight was lifted off his shoulders.

2. Hudson got a good cut in and hit a hard line drive straight back up the middle, but Pettitte managed, somehow, to leap up and catch it, ending Hudson's bid for a hit before he'd gotten out of the batter's box. His head tilted back and he showed off a wry smile.

3. Delmon came through with a double that drove in a run (from first); a batter later, he was picked off while napping on a grounder back to the pitcher. Back in the dugout, Delmon had a big smile* on his face and was chatting happily with teammates.

_* We keep saying that with Delmon's defensive abilities, he'll have to hit like Manny Ramirez to be a good player. (Kind of like the real Manny Ramirez.) Well, continuing to bask in that RBI's warm glow even after costing the team a runner in scoring position by making a boneheaded mistake was just Delmon Being Manny._

Are these the signs of a team playing loose? Or are they signs of a team that's losing faith in itself?

Your answer probably says more about you than it does about the team.

At least ... I'd sure like to think so.
