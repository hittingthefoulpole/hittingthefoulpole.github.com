I just wanted to share <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=7126">this</a> with you guys:
<blockquote><em>"Manny being Manny--I know what that means now. He's an intense workout partner. I think people perceive him the wrong way sometimes, because this guy really loves the game. He loves everything that goes along with it. He's working out hard and he's going to be ready to play this season, for sure."</em>
--Twins infielder <span class="playerdef"><a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/dt/puntoni01.shtml">Nick Punto</a></span>, on working out with Red Sox outfielder <span class="playerdef"><a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/dt/ramirma02.shtml">Manny Ramirez</a></span> this offseason.</blockquote>
That's right. Punto worked out with Manny this offseason. He describes Manny as his "workout partner." So what can we take from this? That Punto has learned to start raising his hands victoriously after smashing a lazy fly ball to left field? Or that he's learned how to make sure his helmet falls off when he runs?

And ... why did Manny Ramirez work out with Nick Punto? I think <em>that</em> is the best example ever of "Manny being Manny." He's just a bit of a weird guy.
