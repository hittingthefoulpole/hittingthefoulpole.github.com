Joe Nathan <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/03/01/nathan-out-of-wbc/">has pulled himself out of the WBC</a> because he has "a sore acromioclavicular joint, better known as the AC joint." (Sounds like something in the shoulder area, but I am not a doctor.)

Nathan has a sore shoulder?! Time to panic! The sky is falling! The Twins are doomed! We needed to sign Cruz! Contract the team! Waaaah!

Oh wait. No. That's not this blog, that's crazy talk. Frankly, I think this is great news. I've been lobbying to get Nathan out of the WBC for months now. And here's what I think happened: Nathan looked at his bad outing the other day, figured "I need to stay with the team and work on this, let's talk about a sore shoulder so people don't think I'm an anti-American terrorist."

Unless this news takes a sudden and debilitating turn for the worse, I'm leaving it in the pile with a smiley face on it.
