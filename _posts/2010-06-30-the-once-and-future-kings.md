The Twins leapfrogged the Tigers and reclaimed first place on Tuesday night.  As Tom Pelissero <a href="http://www.1500espn.com/sportswire/Pelissero_Forget_pitching_for_a_sec_Twins_offense_needs_to_do_its_job">wrote</a> last night, Nick Blackburn was just OK, and that was good enough.

The Twins "offense first" lineup did exactly what everyone expected them to do: score a boatload of runs.   Blackburn induced 12 groundouts, and more importantly he got a first pitch strike on 23 of the 29 batters he faced.  I'm not saying he has turned a corner and we don't need another starter, but if our 3 headed monster of Baker-Blackburn-Slowey and be just OK, our offense should pick them up.  It seems that on that dreadful roadtrip (and for most of June) we were often down early, and the offense would either a) give up immediately or b) not wake up until it was 2 outs in the 8th and we are down 4.  Even Monday's loss was encouraging in that regard because we started getting those first inning runs back pretty early.

Hopefully Slowey can follow in Blackburn's footsteps and not get in an early hole, and keep the Tigers from scoring in bunches.  Hopefully the offense does the rest.
