So I somehow managed to finagle passes to the "Champions Club Open House" at Target Field tonight, which is pretty badass.  So I will be attending with my trusty iPhone camera taking pictures of all the cool things I see, and putting a post together later this weekend.  I'm not sure what parts of the stadium I will have access to, I'm assuming the clubhouse and field will be off limits, which is lame.  If anyone would like to see specific things/parts of the stadium, please let me know in the comments section sometime today. I will post some updates via twitter throughout the evening, but will most likely save all pictures for post tomorrow. 

Although, if there is free beer I rescind all promises because I may get drunk.
