Tim Dierkes has just released a list of <a href="http://www.springtraining09.com/features/the-44-worst-contracts-in-base.php">the worst current contracts in baseball</a>. He came up with 44 of them. And while I figured the Twins have signed some dumb contracts recently, the fact that they have to be current basically narrows it down to just Mike Lamb -- and he threw out everything below $15M total, so I didn't think any Twins would be on the list.

But I was wrong. He listed Michael Cuddyer's $24M deal as one of the 44 worst current contracts in baseball. I think that's a little harsh. The contract is for 3 years and an $8M AAV -- is that completely unreasonable?

Granted, Cuddyer's 2008 was worthless given the injuries (actually worse than worthless according to FanGraphs, who put him at -$1.3M for 2008). But that doesn't necessarily make the contract <em>bad</em>.

He'd established a certain level of performance -- worth $10.8M in 2006 and $8.4M in 2007 -- which were his 27 and 28 year old seasons. You could reasonably expect him to decline 10% per year from his prime years during the contract, which puts his expected value for 2008, 2009, and 2010 at $7.5M, $6.8M, and $6.1M. Baseball Prospectus is considerably less enthusiastic about his chances, projecting him to be worth $4.5M in 2009 and $4.6M in 2010, though most of that is probably due to the "No Twins are capable of hitting a baseball because Minnesota is really far away from anywhere important and also BP is based on the south side of Chicago" factor in their calculations.

The Twins obviously thought Cuddyer would be able to stay healthy and decline slightly less rapidly than 10% per year given his late breakout. It wasn't a completely unreasonable assumption at the time, and it's not out of the question that he returns to his 2007 form this year in 400-450 PA or so. Additionally, Cuddyer is a fan favorite and one of the leaders in the clubhouse, which tends not only to be ignored by the statistical community, but even villainized. I disagree with their hatred for friendly players who show leadership, and I think teams do value that. Especially the Twins.

And while we currently have a logjam in the outfield and Cuddyer may well have been the odd man out if it weren't for the contract, nobody could have predicted that Denard Span would break out like this. And there's nothing wrong with having too many good players.

If Cuddyer continues to suck and get hurt like he did in 2008, the contract will obviously be a disaster, performance-wise. But if he rebounds to a level anything like his 2006 or 2007, the contract won't end up being <em>that</em> bad.
