Well, didn't see that coming.  Apparently A-Rod tested positive for PEDs in 2003, the year he won the MVP.  I always group A-Rod in the "Griffey, Manny, Big Hurt" category.  An out of this world talent who didn't need steroids to be better than everyone.  He was never oddly giant like Bonds, McGwire, or Sosa, he could just flat out hit.  We are kind of isolated from the whole roids issue as Twins fans, mainly because players who use roids tend to be a)expensive, and b) Boras clients.  

I don't hate A-Rod as much as most people.  So what if he is highly paid.  If I could convince someone to pay me 25 mil a year, I'd do it in a heartbeat.  It seemed like all his off the field weirdness (madonna, creepy obbsession with jeter, etc.) didn't start until he moved to the Bronx.  I guess this just goes to show you, that everyone was doing it. It starts to make me question the rest of the elite hitters currently in the game.  Especially the power hitters.  Mauer clearly isn't on steroids because I think the odds of him hitting 20 homers in a season are about the same as the odds of me doing so.  Morneau is from Canada, so he is fueled by maple syrup and beer. Is there anyone on the twins that you feel is on steroids or is likely to start.  Delmon comes to mind for some reason.  I could see him buckling under the pressure of "No. 1 pick".
