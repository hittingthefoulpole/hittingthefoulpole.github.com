Jim Souhan wrote an <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/16007107.html">article</a> about Nick Punto in today's star tribune.  Can you really call it a slump if it lasts an entire year?  I say no.  Also, Punto thinks he can be our leadoff hitter in April, well season starts in March buddy.  I know its good to have a versatile player like Punto on the team.  We used to have Denny Hocking, now we have Punto.  Hocking couldn't hit his way out of a paper bag, neither can Punto.  He wouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence as the starters if it weren't for Gardy's love of "scrappiness".  I have nothing against Punto personally, I'm sure he is a nice guy, and from what I read he is great in the clubhouse.  However, in baseball, and in life, you have to know your role.  His is "utility infielder".  There are worse things you could be than pretty much the first guy off the bench for one of the most respected organizations in the majors. 

I also don't like how he mentioned he wasn't going to change his swing.  Guy comes off a year where he was lucky to hit .210 and he is going to change....nothing? really?  At least tell me you are going to try to change something.  I understand defense is very important, especially with a young pitching staff.  But how can Punto even be considered over Brendan Harris.  Harris played out of position all last year, so he will be much better at second than he was at short.  Also, he is leaps and bounds a better hitter than Punto.  So having above average (albeit overrated) defense and the worst bat of all time, against an average glove and an above average bat is a competition? Come on.
