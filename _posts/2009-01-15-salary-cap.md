There have been a few owners, namely Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, who have been clamoring for a salary cap this offseason after the Yankees bought seemingly everyone.  I figure this is as good a topic as any to discuss.

I think a salary cap will help a lot of teams, but it won't really make as big a difference as people think.  Proponents of a cap claim it will create parity, like in the NFL.  I disagree.  MLB already has parity.  We haven't had a repeat World Series winner since, when?, the Yankees in 1999 and 2000?  That was really even before they started spending insane amounts of money.  They didn't sign Giambi to his mega-deal until after 2001.  What did that get them?  No rings, that's what.  The Red Sox have won two rings recently (2004, 2007) and have had a pretty hefty payroll.  However, many contributors weren't high priced players.  In their most recent series run, Jacoby Ellsbury played a huge role, and he plays for peanuts.  Josh Beckett is still (and was at the time) under contract at a reasonable price.  Same goes for David Ortiz.  Manny signed a mega-contract the same year as A-Rod, and was a little over halfway through it in 2007.  JD Drew was their big free agent pick up, 5 years, 70 mil.  He didn't really do much, except have one good playoff game.  Ortiz was making 12.5 mil, which is reasonable, if not a good deal, considering his output,  Beckett only made 6mil in 07.  I could go on, but I think you get my point.  The red sox didn't win that year just by outspending everyone.  In fact, I would argue that nobody has ever won a world series simply by throwing money at players until they got a ring.  Everyone mentions the Yankees, but as I said, they haven't won a title since 2000.  In that year, they had only three guys make over 10 million.  Bernie Williams, David Cone, and Derek Jeter. The payroll was around 100 million, but considering the economic boom we were in (even though it was almost over) they had to be raking in money hand over fist.

I think the more pressing issue is fixing the draft system.  This is where the big money teams (Yankees, Res Sox, etc) have an advantage.  The bad teams have high draft picks, but more often than not the elite players tend to drop to the teams with deeper pockets.  If I am an elite baseball player, I know that I can demand the moon as a signing bonus and I will drop until someone (most likely the Yankees) gets me.  If a person unfamiliar with baseball looks at the first round of a draft, and each player's corresponding signing bonus, it won't make sense.  The largest signing bonuses will probably be towards the bottom.

In summary, I don't think the problem is overall free agent spending.  Its the draft process.  Should we put a cap on signing bonuses?  That is probably half the problem. Now we have kids getting major league contracts.  In the NFL I don't think signing bonuses count against the cap, so instituting a salary cap won't help all that much.  This slotting system is really bogus too.  Maybe if they enforce that, it could be a start.  What do you guys think?
