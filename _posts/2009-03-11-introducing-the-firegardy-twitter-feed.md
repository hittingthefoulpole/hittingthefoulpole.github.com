Here at Fire Gardy, we like to try new things. Sometimes those things are cool and useful, and sometimes they're useless and crappy, and sometimes nobody notices or cares. I don't know which one of those this newest thing will be, but I feel like it's worth at least pointing out so you can make  that decision for yourself.

Introducing the #firegardy Twitter feed! I don't know if you've noticed the seemingly random bits of text that are now showing up at the top of the page (beneath the big logo), but those are called "tweets," and they're hosted by Twitter. I installed that little program yesterday, and what it does is go out to Twitter and ask for all the tweets with "#firegardy" in them somewhere, and if so, prints the most recent five of them right here on our site.

This is a way for me or FunBobby to toss something up quickly that's not worth a full post but we feel should be part of the Fire Gardy conversation. And it's also another way for <em>you</em> to join the Fire Gardy conversation. And you can post from anywhere (except, somewhat ironically, directly from our site). For example, I do many of my posts from my iPhone, and many more from Twitter itself, and more still from programs installed on my various computers.

I don't know exactly where the #firegardy Twitter feed is going to go. Ideally we can use it to have ongoing in-game conversations that will be recorded for (fleeting) posterity right at the top of the page. And I fully encourage everyone to join in the fun by signing up for <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> and throwing up some #firegardy posts.

(And as an added note, I know that Joe Mauer is trying Twitter out, and Morneau has a PR firm running an account for him. If we could somehow convince Mauer to participate in The Newest Feature of the Bloggingest Blog of Blogs, it would be quite thrilling. So if you see him, let him know.)

Oh, and one last thing. Eat your heart out Gleeman.
