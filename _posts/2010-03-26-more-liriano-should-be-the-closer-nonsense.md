[Joe Christensen continues to pound the "Liriano to the bullpen!" drum for some reason](http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/89223987.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUsZ), and Gardy's not having it. At the moment.

> "Frankie's a rotation guy; not going to be a bullpener," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "I'm going to tell you that, right now. Then, in another week, I'll tell you if he's still a rotation guy." 

> The Twins are taking this strategy because they're exploring trades to replace closer Joe Nathan. They don't want to ask Liriano to be their closer one day, only to make a trade, which would leave them scrambling to turn Liriano back into a starter. 

I hope the reason the Twins are reluctant to move Liriano to the closer role isn't just because they're afraid of telling him one thing, then doing something behind his back that turns what they'd previously said into a lie -- especially since they don't need to do either. I hope it's more along the lines of "Liriano is leading the majors in strikeouts in Spring Training, and he's not walking _anybody_, maybe, just _maybe_, a guy with a 22/2 K/BB ratio is good enough to be the 5th starter on a team without a #1 starter, or a #2 starter, or a #3 starter." I hope this story keeps coming up because people just need to find something to write about that isn't "Holy shit, the Twins are going to win 95 games and cruise to the AL Central title by at least 10 wins," because while that's probably what's going to happen, "predicting" it will get you called a fool and being right won't happen for eight months and nobody will remember or care that you were right. If anything they'll just remember that they thought you were a fool at the time. So ... invent some controversy!

But this isn't even reasonable, right? If you didn't know anything about Liriano -- you didn't know about his amazing 2006, or his injury, or his struggle to recover from surgery -- and all you saw was a guy with 22 strikeouts and 2 walks in 14 innings in Spring Training, what would you think? Would you think: "Oh yeah, get him the hell out of the rotation, starters shouldn't be allowed to pitch that well." Fuck no you wouldn't think that.

[Rob Neyer takes a look at it this afternoon](http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/2932/no-5-starter-update-twins), in his ongoing series of looking into the 5th starter plans* of all the major league teams.

_* This amuses me greatly, because Neyer is on the forefront this spring of making the point that the "5th starter" designation is largely pointless, because **nobody** ever has 5 starters who make 30 starts, or 24 starts, or 20 starts. The "5th starter" just an interchangeable guy, and might be better served as a platoon of long relievers and prospects anyway. You may or may not agree with that, but the point is that the guy who most strongly agrees with it is also the one paying the most attention to who gets selected as the 5th starters around the league, and writing about it. Just saying._

And Neyer's take made me feel a little better, because he's as confused as I am.

> Maybe it's just me, but when I see a starter with two walks and 22 strikeouts, I'm reminded of why his best role is as a starter. 

> I'm a little perplexed by this supposed plan. Instead of going with one of their many adequate relievers to finish the close games, they're trying to trade for some other team's adequate reliever. If they don't add another adequate reliever, they're going to ask their most dominant starting pitcher to become a reliever? 

It doesn't seem to make sense, does it. And of course, Neyer's using the word "dominating" in the sense of performance-based metrics, which for pitchers means "strikeouts and walks," and Liriano has the best numbers out of anybody. Not just on the Twins, but anybody. Eleven strikeouts per walk. You do that over the course of a whole season and they'll give you two Cy Young awards at the end of the year. 

_* Santana peaked at 5.2 K/BB, Lincecum at 3.8, and Greinke got up to 4.75 in 2009. 11 is **off the fucking charts**._

Of course, nobody's saying Liriano can keep that pace up. It's impossible for a reason. But don't you want to at least _find out_ before you make a decision that's even more damaging to the team's chances of winning than losing Nathan in the first place?

> Hey, it could work. The Twins are famous for their scouting acumen, and choosing this season's closer is a pure scouting decision. If it's my team, though, I see if Liriano can maintain a brilliant strikeout-to-walk ratio over the course of 200 innings rather than 65.

Yes. My thoughts exactly. Let's hope the Twins' front office is a little bit calmer than the writers who are getting ravenous for a storyline.
