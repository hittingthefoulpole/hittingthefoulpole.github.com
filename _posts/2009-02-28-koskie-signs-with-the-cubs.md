Corey Koskie has been <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2009/02/cubs-sign-corey.html">signed by the Cubs</a>.  It is a minor league deal, so there is no risk for the Cubs.  He will be competing for the backup third base job.  I've always liked Koskie and I hope this is a sign that he will be able to get a job somewhere.  If he doesn't make the Cubs, hopefully he will show something in camp that will get him noticed.  

Good luck, Corey.
