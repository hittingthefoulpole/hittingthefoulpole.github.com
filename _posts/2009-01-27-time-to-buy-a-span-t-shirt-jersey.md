Just saw a little note about something that happened at TwinsFest. It's a small thing, but it leads me to wonder: <a href="http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_11552950">Is it even possible any more not to like Denard Span?</a> I mean, come on:
<blockquote>Denard Span remembers when Torii Hunter picked him up at his hotel during TwinsFest a half-dozen years ago, and how he took him to dinner and showed him around the Metrodome.

"I promised Torii that whenever I made it, whoever the next guy was, I would try to take him under my wing and help him out the same way," Span said.

He got his chance over the weekend, serving as an informal chaperone for Ben Revere, the Twins' 20-year-old center fielder of the future. A nice gesture â€” particularly because Span doesn't have an entire season of major league experience yet himself.

"It's a little weird. I guess I'm starting to get old already," Span joked. "It seems like just last year that I was just like him. I can tell he's nervous, doesn't know what to say. I remember being the same way."</blockquote>
We were not alone in disparaging Denard last year when he was trying to break in with the big club, and his bravado seemed completely out of place given his minor league numbers. It looked like he would be -- at best -- a mediocre stopgap until Gomez was ready in a year or so.

Boy was everyone wrong.

He's the fourth best hitter on the team, and his center fielder's range makes a mockery of right field -- earning him the nickname "Mr Web Gem" from the guys on ESPN. (Although I don't think anyone with a cool name like "Denard Span" should have a nickname.) He has great plate discipline, good speed, and an accurate arm.

Span turns 25 one month from today. And he's already turning into a leader, despite not even having a full year of service time under his belt.

That settles it. I need to buy a Span t-shirt jersey.
