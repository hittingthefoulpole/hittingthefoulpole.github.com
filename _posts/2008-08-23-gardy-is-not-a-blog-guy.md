Recently, Pat Neshek posted on <a href="http://www.eteamz.com/patneshek/index.cfm">his blog</a> that he's on the Really Really Slow plan and won't make it back this season. Gardy was approached about this, and <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2008/08/22/twins-announce-arizona-fall-league-assignments/">asked his opinion</a>.
<blockquote>“I’m not a blog guy,” he said. “I’ll let the trainers and doctors tell me, rather than the blog guys."</blockquote>
I can only presume he went on to say: "After all, whoever wrote that lives in his mom's basement and isn't good at anything." He became even more confused when informed that Neshek actually <em>wrote</em> it, and that anyone is allowed to have one. Even, perhaps, trainers and doctors.

In all seriousness, though, his stance makes sense. Neshek isn't an expert, and he actually did go on to mention that Casilla also thought he'd be out for the season when he went down, and quickly changed his tune when things started to go well. The point isn't that Neshek will be back in two weeks like Casilla was -- rather, that statements like "I can't make it back this year" are almost always made at the depths of despair and pain, and are not objective. Trusting the opinions of the trainers and doctors (and Neshek's arm, not his head) is obviously what the manager should do.
