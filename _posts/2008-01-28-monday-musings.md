We all know that Nick Punto is not a good player, and have really no idea why he is allowed to particpate in a major league baseball game.  Gardy seems to be in love with him because "he can catch the ball".  At most, that is 50% of the game.  Punto is a terrible hitter, that includes bunting, getting on base, moving runners over, etc.  Since he lacks the ability to get on base, he is not an effective baserunner.  How many times have we had a runner (or runners) on base and Punto failed to not only get himself on base, but also failed to move any of the runners up a base? The answer seems to be a lot.  He is basically a free out.  I will concede that he probably isn't as bad as his nearly .200 batting average was last year, but he is closer to that than to the .290 he hit in 2006.  I have yet to hear a reason, other than "he catches the ball pretty good", for playing Punto on a regular basis.  On Gardy's appearance on KFAN the other day, one of the reasons he gave was that Punto was annoying on the bench, so gardy didn't want to have to deal with that.  That is a terrible reason, and probably a joke.  Although looking at Punto its pretty obvious that one would get very annoyed very fast after spending very little time with him.  So if anyone has a legitimate reason for Nick Punto get regular ABs I would like to hear them.  The following have already been covered and cannot be used again:

1) He "catches the ball pretty good". This is not a good enough reason because Punto is so bad at the plate that his above average defense does not make up for it.  Some players prevent enough runs playing defense that if they are below average at hitting, its ok. Punto is not one of them.

2)I have heard no other real reasons for Punto getting ABs.  When there is only one decent reason for a guy to get ABs you know you are in trouble. Unless its A-Rod and that one reason is "there are almost no flaws in his all around game"
