While many of us have been assuming that Gomez will be competing for a CF spot in spring training, or that the Twins should sign Kenny Lofton for a year, <a href="http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_8114993">Justin Morneau disagrees</a>:
<blockquote><span id="default">"We now have our center fielder and leadoff hitter that we needed, and added some good young arms at the same time," Justin Morneau wrote in an e-mail about the Santana trade.</span></blockquote>
He seems satisfied with the trade, and has a high opinion of the young Gomez. I think that's much more important than the accuracy of his scouting report (how much can Morneau really know about Gomez?). It wasn't too long ago that I was worried about Morneau's commitment to this team, and that he was just waiting to sign a big deal elsewhere. Clearly, that isn't the case any more. And his contract seems to have removed any semblance of a mercenary mentality.

We'll see how that translates on the field. We'll also see how the CF/lead-off race shakes out.
