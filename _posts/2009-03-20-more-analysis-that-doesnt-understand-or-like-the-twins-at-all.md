Is anybody else in the mood for reading about the Twins being criticized by another self-described statistical analysis for not having the patience of the nation's average drug-addled 10 year old? Because I sure do!

This time around it's Jay Jaffe of Baseball Prospectus, <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=8644">recapping the offseason moves made by each of the teams in the AL Central</a>.
<blockquote>Testing, testing... is this thing on?</blockquote>
Nice little bit of humor there to start out; I'm guessing he intends to focus on the fact that, as an analyst following baseball, he finds our lack of activity boring.
<blockquote>The Twins may have had the quietest winter of any team in the majors in terms of departures and arrivals, particularly considering that one of the three players they've brought in was a Rule 5 pick (Jones) who may or may not stick.</blockquote>
Aren't the Twins usually one of the quietest teams every winter? I mean, given that they don't really participate in the free agent market? I continue to wait for people to stop being surprised that the Twins act the same way every year, and every year it works. I guess I'll have to keep on waiting.
<blockquote>Then again, given the way Ayala was run out of Queens by a pitchfork-toting mob, it makes a certain type of sense that he wound up with a team that itself seems to be laying low.</blockquote>
I wasn't huge on signing Ayala, either. But given the state of our bullpen he could be a valuable piece. And I don't know if operating by a philosophy of "well our entire team is under 25 years old and we expect them to keep getting better, so we're going to go ahead and let that happen without doing anything stupid to mess it up" should be considered "laying low." Maybe it should. Your call, Jay.
<blockquote>While the Twins lost relatively little this winter—a pair of lefty relievers and a light-hitting shortstop—it's not at all clear that when they spent, they spent wisely.</blockquote>
Leave it to a balanced analyst to bend "lost relatively little," usually a compliment, into an insult. This is exactly the kind of article that should be hidden behind BP's pay-me-and-enjoy-it-you-dumbasses subscription wall.
<blockquote>Crede's last two years have been marred by back woes, and he'll likely have to surpass his 75<sup>th</sup>-percentile <span class="statdef">PECOTA</span><a onmouseover="doTooltip(event, jpfl_getStat('PECOTA'))" onmouseout="hideTip()" href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=PECOTA"></a> performance (.258/.316/.436) in order to outdo the impact of the .283/.330/.399 combined showing the Twins got from last year's third basemen, <span class="playerdef">Brian Buscher</span>, <span class="playerdef">Brendan Harris</span>, and <span class="playerdef">Mike Lamb</span>; the first two would have handled the job this year, while the latter is still on the payroll (although playing for Milwaukee) after being cut less than halfway through a two-year deal. As a one-year gamble, at least it's not a horribly expensive one.</blockquote>
In other words, this was a completely boneheaded move that never should have happened and the Twins have to get <em>absurdly lucky</em> in order for Crede to come close to matching last year's Buscher/Harris/Lamb platoon. What a huge waste of money! And why compare Crede's 2009 PECOTA projection with Buscher/Harris/Lamb's 2008 actual performance, rather than some combination of Buscher/Harris 2009 PECOTA projections? Don't want to open up the possibility that a) Buscher/Harris could be a viable option on a team which cannot possibly have any viable options, or b) that signing Crede might have been a good idea. Oh yeah, and ... it's a one year deal that isn't expensive, so it's not much of a risk. Either way, don't disregard my criticism!
<blockquote>What cost far more while making less sense was the need to spend $8.5 million to replace Everett with two years of Juan Castro <span class="playerdef">Nick Punto</span>, who will have to surpass last year's 90<sup>th</sup>-percentile <span class="statdef">PECOTA</span><a onmouseover="doTooltip(event, jpfl_getStat('PECOTA'))" onmouseout="hideTip()" href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=PECOTA"></a> to approach his 2.8 WARP;</blockquote>
Burn! Nick Punto is Juan Castro! Ha ha! I literally have no idea why Jaffe would talk about Punto's 2008 PECOTA projection, other than to point out that PECOTA was simply way off on that projection. And, um, I don't think that was his point. (It's true, though. PECOTA totally missed on Punto.) I mean, why not point out that PECOTA projects Punto's 2009 campaign to be execrable? As in, 0.5 WARP. And if he hits the 90th percentile, just 2.2 WARP. Seems like that would have been a more effective argument for Jaffe to make here.

What would have been considerably <em>less</em> effective is to point out that $4M per season is the going rate for a good utility player these days, most teams don't have one, and Punto is ours. So ... this signing is not a disaster. The only problem with it is that we seem to think Punto can be the shortstop, day in and day out, and that's just not what he does. That's not where his value lies. And that's not what we're paying him for. Not having a shortstop is a mistake -- but Punto is better than Everett. 
<blockquote>as ever, nobody gives themselves a leg down (as opposed to a leg up) in competing for a division title like this franchise.</blockquote>
Whoa! I guess now is the time to pull out the big guns. After all, the Twins simply haven't competed for a division title this decade, and the reason is because they continue to fail to follow the tried-and-true SPEND-MORE-MONEY playbook. If only the Twins threw big money deals at aging home run hitters who can't play a position in the field, they might have been able to contend more than zero times in the last eight years.

What? You're telling me the last decade <em>hasn't</em> been an unmitigated disaster for this franchise? Well, then I think Mr Jaffe might just be going a little overboard in criticizing a team he (and his employers) don't particularly care for.
<blockquote>The drop from 88 wins last year to a projected 77 suggests a lot of regression, particularly in the rotation, not to mention the possible limitations of <span class="playerdef">Joe Mauer</span> due to back woes.</blockquote>
What would be quite a regression. After all, it's reasonable to suspect that a group of talented 23 year old players with athleticism and tools would start their decline at age 24. And it's pretty much unquestionable that replacing Livan Hernandez with Francisco Liriano was an unforgivable move; Liriano's career is over, whereas Livan's future is bright! Wait a minute ... did he say the rotation figures to <em>get worse this year</em>? I think he did.

Does that invalidate everything else he said about the Twins?

Not necessarily, I guess. But it sure doesn't help his credibility.
