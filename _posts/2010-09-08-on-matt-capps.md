When the Twins traded (apparently former) top prospect Wilson Ramos for (allegedly proven) closer Matt Capps, I was not thrilled -- Ramos had been in the conversation as the headliner of a deal for Cliff Lee, and when the Yankees and Rangers outbid the Twins, Ramos became the headliner of a deal for Dan Haren. After it became clear that Haren didn't want any part of participating in a playoff race -- I assume that was his reason for putting the Twins on his no-trade clause -- Bill Smith apparently felt that _Wilson Ramos must go_, no matter the return.

So Capps and I got off to a bad start. He was going to have to pitch _really, really well_ to dig himself out of the hole that Smith dug for him -- and even then, it may not have been enough. I say that to get my bias out of the way.

Since coming to the Twins, Capps has pitched 18 innings in 18 games, with a seemingly-shiny 2.00 ERA. Opposing hitters are hitting .288/.347/.379 off him -- not great, but it's not like he's getting lit up -- and that's with the benefit of a .353 BABIP. He's blown a couple of saves, but the Twins have not lost a game that he's entered with the lead.

After using him primarily as a full-inning Closer through August -- and giving him extended days of rest while the rest of the bullpen went down with the ship -- Gardy has already thrown Capps into some unusual situations so far in September. On Friday, September 3, Capps entered the game in the 8th inning with one out and men on 1st and 3rd, with just a one run lead; he escaped the jam in the 8th and pitched a scoreless 9th for an impressive five-out save. At that point I considered writing this article, admitting that I may have been wrong about Capps, and that he's really not the worst thing to happen to Closing Ballgames since Latroy Hawkins.

But on Sunday, September 5, Capps turned in the most Capps-like outing possible. He entered the game with a three run lead with two outs in the 9th inning, and a man on second base. The game had been in the bag for a while, as the Twins had held a 6-2 lead since the 7th inning; the Rangers hadn't scored since the 2nd, and had never been as close as tied since Cuddyer doubled in two runs in the bottom of the first. So after Rauch managed to turn it into a Save Situation in the 9th, Capps came in to drive up his arbitration price this winter. He gave up a single to Christian Guzman, a single to Michael Young, and walked Daniel Murphy. The bases were loaded, still two outs, and the score was 6-4. Vladimir Guerrero was batting. The fun, easy victory that had been dancing on my TV screen for a few hours was being chained to the floor and tortured by the unfriendly-looking Capps -- what had that victory ever done to him?

Guerrero hit a ball up the middle, and it looked like the game would be tied. But Orlando Hudson showed a surprising amount of range and saved the game -- he'd keep it tied for at least one more batter! -- and then, when he thought he wouldn't have a play, he saw Michael Young rounding third base just a little too far and fired. It was a close play at third, but Young had reached the bag safely. The umpire, though, didn't seem to care about that. He saw some inadvertent contact between Young and the third base coach, and called Young out to end the game.

Matt Capps got his Save, and he did it without retiring a single batter. I'm sure that's happened before, but I can't remember it and I don't know how to look it up.

And I suppose this is the thing about Capps. He can be so infuriating at times -- blowing saves, being awarded saves despite facing four batters and retiring _zero_ of them, all the while sporting this strangely bemused look on his face -- that I just want to tweet cruel things like ["Matt Capps is definitely going to help the Twins in the playoffs. Help them lose."](http://twitter.com/sirsean/status/21545136687) and ["If Wilson Ramos never makes it to the majors, the Twins still got screwed on that trade. #IHateMattCapps"](http://twitter.com/sirsean/status/21455925953), and "After the game we're taking a trip to the glue factory, and Matt Capps doesn't get to come!" (I didn't actually tweet that last one, but it's been waiting on the tips of my fingers for the next time Capps blows a save.)

On the other hand, he does have a solid fastball, and he does help win games. He's [the third person to ever record 10 saves in both leagues in one season](http://twitter.com/Twins_morsecode/status/23269877688), which isn't nothing. He looks like Louis CK pretending to be a baseball player.

![Matt Capps' Face](http://hittingthefoulpole.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/matt_capps-300x200.jpg "Seriously, deny that he looks like Louis CK")

That's going to make me laugh every time I look at Matt Capps from now on. Seriously, try to deny that he looks like Louis CK making fun of being a baseball player. You can't do it.

His very presence pushes the rest of the relievers forward an inning, which improves the bullpen regardless of how well he actually does -- and as noted, despite the rollercoaster ride, the Twins have won every game he's entered with a lead. And, at the end of the day, that's what you pay your Closer for.

I suppose this is what I'm trying to say:

**Matt Capps, I will never forgive you for that trade, no matter how long you live.**

No, wait. That's not it. Let's try that again:

**Matt Capps, that trade wasn't your fault. You didn't make the Twins give up Wilson Ramos. Just keep up the good work, and I'll try to stop having a heart attack every time you release a pitch. Deal?**

Maybe it's a bit of both.
