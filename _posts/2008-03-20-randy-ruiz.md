Happy first tourney day everyone!  I've been casually following this Randy Ruiz fellow the twins have at camp, and man, he can really mash the ball.  I'm starting to root for him to get the final bench spot.  This does bring up a few problems.  Ruiz has no glove, he can maybe play first. Maybe.  He provides good right handed power off the bench, which the twins need.  Just to double check, our position players so far are: Mauer, Redmond, Morneau, Harris, Punto, Everett, Lamb, Kubel, Monroe, Cuddyer, Young, CF.  Assuming we carry 12 pitchers, this leaves one spot on the bench.  When kubel is DHing (hopefully more often than not) the bench consists of Monroe, Punto, Redmond.  Does Monroe/Kubel count as our 5th outfielder as well as our DH or is Gardy planning on carrying an additional backup OF?  I would say as of now Buscher has the leg up for the final spot because of his ability to play third (and quite well, too).  Ruiz will be a nice option if someone gets hurt (I'm looking at your Monroe) to come up from AAA and be a masher off the bench.  With Buscher and Monroe (or eventually Ruiz replacing one of them) that gives us nice power options on the bench. Something we haven't had in a while, if ever.  In the past few years our best power option off the bench was L-Rod.  I have a good feeling about this lineup. However, I doubt Gardy will maximize its potential and they will do much worse than they should.  I realize this post wasn't Ruiz-centric, but I needed a title. And I'm out of witty slogans like "Tuesdays with Gardy".  "Thursdays with Ulger"?  who would want to spend Thursday with him? Only Gardy.
