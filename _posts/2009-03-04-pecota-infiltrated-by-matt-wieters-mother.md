Today <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3951581&amp;searchName=Neyer_Rob&amp;campaign=rsssrch&amp;source=neyer_rob">Rob Neyer points out the absurd PECOTA projection for Orioles catching prospect Matt Wieters</a>: .311/.395/.544! PECOTA is the computer projection system employed by Baseball Prospectus, and is typically pretty conservative in its projections. (Except in the case of Twins players, in which case it is <em>extremely</em> conservative. For example, it projects Mauer to lose 25 points of OBP and drop a full win off his WARP. And Morneau is projected to never again be as good as he was in any of the last three years, and to decline rapidly despite the fact that he's right in the middle of his prime. They're projecting a 1.5 win drop in Morneau's WARP, which is pretty significant.)

Anyhow, PECOTA is not conservative at all when it comes to Wieters. It significantly undershot uber-prospects Evan Longoria and Geovani Soto a year ago, despite the huge numbers they put up in the minors. In fact, the numbers it's projecting for Wieters are historic. It'd basically be an OPS+ of 143, which catchers have done just 62 times since 1908. And if you believe Rob Neyer's research, just 8 times by a catcher under 25 years old. And two of those seasons happened three years ago, in 2006:
<blockquote>It happened three years ago. In 2006, 22-year-old Brian McCann and 23-year-old Joe Mauer posted nearly identical OPS+ figures (McCann 143, Mauer 144). Mauer had played only 40 games above Double-A (five in Triple-A, 35 in the majors); McCann skipped Triple-A completely, but played 59 games with the big club before his breakout season.</blockquote>
Obviously those were impressive seasons from Mauer and McCann. Except that Mauer had played a few more games than that, given that 2006 was Mauer's second full season in the majors. He'd played 35 games in 2004, and 131 in 2005 (in which he hit just .294/.372/.411, for a 107 OPS+), before bursting forth with his batting-title-winning 2006 and .347/.429/.507 and its 144 OPS+.

I'm always excited by big time projections for young players like Wieters. But I'd like to see the guy play before assuming he's the best catcher of all time. It took Mauer a year to adjust to the majors despite huge success in the minors, and McCann had a 59 game cup of coffee before his first full season. And both Mauer and McCann were younger in 2006 than Wieters is now, and Wieters' age was the major factor in PECOTA's projection.

And PECOTA projects that Wieters will maintain that production or better every year until he's 30, at which point he will finally begin to slowly decline. Basically, vote him into the Hall of Fame now, because he's the best god damn catcher there's ever been.

I'm going to pin Neyer's forgetting that Mauer played major league baseball for the Minnesota Twins in 2005 on the fact that, like most Red Sox Fans, he is unaware that the Twins existed in 2005. Or at all.

And I'm going to pin PECOTA's projection for Wieters on the fact that he'll be playing in the AL East, where men are men and the coast isn't far away.
