Fox sports released their <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/powerRankings">power rankings</a> for the 2008 MLB season.  The Twins are ranked 20th with the following blurb
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">You don’t lose stars like Johan Santana and center fielder Torii Hunter and get better. But the Twins didn’t exactly come away empty this spring. Delmon Young and Carlos Gomez will be solid, possibly great, performers for years to come. The pitching could be competitive if Francisco Liriano comes all the way back and Boof Bonser takes a step forward.</p>

<p align="left">I think this is a decent preseason ranking, after losing two all-stars its hard to rank us very high.  That being said, I think we are better than the white sox, who are ranked 17th.  3 spots in a preseason ranking really doesn't mean much. </p>
<p align="left">The top three of the Tigers, Indians, and Red Sox is a pretty safe bet.  I think having the D-Backs at 4 is a little nuts.  In my opinion no NL team cracks the top 5.  After the Red Sox, I see LAA and the Yankees.  Maybe I would drop the Yankees below the D-backs because they have three young starters they are relying a lot on.  I disagree with the Royals being dead last.  They are slightly better than that.  The Pirates, in my opinion, are the least talented organization from top to bottom in the majors.  The Royals probably come in third to last ahead of the Marlins and the Pirates. </p>
<p align="left">It is difficult to rank AL teams against NL teams.  They really should do two seperate lists.  There were non-playoff AL teams that were better than playoff NL playoff teams.  The Cubs come to mind, mainly because I don't like them, but also they were not very good last year.  Them winning the NL central was like when the Twins won the AL central when it was the worst division in the history of sports. </p>
<p align="left"> Note: Liriano will be late for camp due to visa problems stemming from his 2006 DUI.  They are saying a week at most.  He has to go to a alcohol management class or something in order to get his work visa.  Doesn't seem like it will be a big problem.</p>
