So the Silver Slugger awards were announced this week, and a few more trophies are headed to Minnesota to further clutter the shelves in the Mauer and Morneau residences.

The M&amp;M Boys each won the award for the second time (the first was in 2006), and it indicates that they were the best hitters at their position in the American League. Mauer's really no surprise, he's obviously the best hitting catcher in the AL right now; Morneau, however, is in the thick of a really tough crowd at first base, and should be both proud and grateful for coming out ahead of Kevin Youkilis, Miguel Cabrera, Mark Texeira, and the rest of the 1B/DH crowd (ie, all the players on the White Sox, Tigers, and Yankees).

I have two questions on this. Given that Morneau has been voted to be a better hitter than Youkilis, and that the gap in their defense is small at best, is it at all possible that Youkilis finishes ahead of Morneau in the MVP voting? (My guess is "yes," because Boston has more sportswriters than anywhere else for some reason. Oh yeah. ESPN.)

My second question: What does Morneau have to do to get some respect? <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&amp;id=3701008">Seriously</a>. ESPN remembers that Mauer won before, but not Morneau? They list this as his first career Silver Slugger, when it's obviously not. Here's the list of <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/awards/mlb_awards_content.jsp?content=silver_slugger_history">historical winners</a>; scroll all the way down to 2006 (about 3 inches) and note that Justin Morneau did indeed win. Is this lack of respect from ESPN related to the upcoming Youkilis/Pedroia-loving that's sure to come from the MVP voters? (My guess is "yes," for the reasons given in the above parentheses.)

So congratulations to Mauer, and congratulations to Morneau. You guys are good: keep up the good work.

Oh, and what are the opposite of congratulations? Rebuke-ulations? Good enough.

Rebuke-ulations to you, ESPN, for slighting Morneau yet again. Jerks.
