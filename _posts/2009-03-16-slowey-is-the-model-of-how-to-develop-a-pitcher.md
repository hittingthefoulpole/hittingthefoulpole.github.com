Just a quick post here ... I was reading the take on the <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=8623">Twins' team health report</a> from Baseball Prospectus and came across this gem:
<blockquote>If I were asked to point to a player as a model of "how to develop a pitcher," then Slowey is one that would come to mind. Just look at how he has progressed, and how all of his stats seem to follow. He's going to be huge this year.</blockquote>
It's just great to read lines like that about one of the young pitchers we're counting on for a big year.
