Before I went to last nights Twins "game", I attended a cocktail party for a committee I'm on at a high end jewelry store.  As I was waiting for my friends to arrive an employee noticed the Twins tickets in my pocket and asked me if I was attending the game, I told her I was.  She then proceeded to tell me that "Lexi" (I'm assuming she was talking about Casilla. Did she think she was cool by throwing a nickname at me?) had been in the store earlier that day.  She said we were going to win because she rubbed his hand for good luck.  Creepy.  I asked if he had made a purchase, and she told me it was confidential.  What?  How is whether or not Casilla bought a watch confidential information.  Get off your high horse, jewelry store employee. Selling high end watches doesn't make you better than me.  She then went on and on about how great Casilla is.  She said he was going to be the next Kirby.  That is the most ludacris comparison ever. They are of different ethnic backgrounds, play different positions, one is a great hitter, the other hasn't proved to be anything more than average.  How is Casilla the next Kirby?   Was she referring to the fact that they both are   good people,  help the community, are role models, etc?  Well in that case, I would give that crown to Mauer.  I decided to no longer engage this woman as she came off as a total moron.

The game wasn't much of one.  Well, it was a nice little pitchers duel between Liriano and Halladay for 6 innings.  Then our team of arsonists we call a bullpen came in a doused the place with gasoline and any chance we had of winning went up in flames.  I think we are starting to realize how important Mauer is behind the plate.  He can't get back soon enough.  Redmond is a great backup, and it seems that Morales is barely better than Vic Martienz behind the plate. Although he did do a good job of getting to some balls that bounced past him.  Outside of Liriano, this game had very few bright spots.  We did get two plays in Sportscenter's top plays; the Cuddyer catch, and the Buscher play at third.

We need Blackburn to go deep in the game tonight, or else we might see a lot of Phil Humber and RA Dickey.  I shudder at the thought.
