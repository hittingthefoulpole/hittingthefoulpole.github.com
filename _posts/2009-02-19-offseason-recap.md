The offseason isn't <em>quite</em> over yet, but the entire team is in Fort Myers, ready for Spring Training. Baseball season is right around the corner. And while there are still a few loose ends waiting to be tied up (or ignored), now seems like a good enough time to recap the Twins' offseason.

The team has not offered Type B free agent Dennys Reyes a contract, expecting a sandwich round compensation pick in return for him; that pick has not materialized as nobody else is more excited about Reyes than we are. There are rumblings today that if Reyes lowers his salary demands that he might return to the Twins. Despite the universal feeling that Reyes entering a game virtually ends it, he was worth 0.6 wins last season and could be worth up to $2M. Breslow was worth 0.8 wins, and giving him Reyes' job would probably work just fine, so retaining Reyes should not be a high priority item.

We signed Jason Kubel to a 2 year, $7M contract that buys out his remaining arbitration years, with an option for his first year of free agency. Statheads around the country laughed at our foolishness, because Kubel is <em>worthless</em> and in case you haven't noticed <em>is slow and can't really play defense!!!</em> But he's a DH, and is the third best hitter on the team behind Mauer and Morneau. He was already under team control, and the Twins just gave him a little security in return for cost control. There's nothing wrong with this deal, it's now up to Kubel to start hitting the ball over the fence.

Nick Punto cashed in once again; he's had two good seasons in his career -- 2006 and 2008 -- and both have netted him contracts. Other than that, he's been mediocre at best; his only value in a non-contract year is the fact that he's nominally capable of playing several positions. It's a 2 year, $8M deal, which appears to be right around the market value for a utility infielder these days; that is, if you don't also have someone like Tolbert on your team who can also play all the infield positions and not really hit all that well. There'll be a lot of Punto-related anger this season and presumably questions about Smith's abilities as a GM while Punto struggles mightily in 2009, but he'll have a good 2010 as he tries to prove he's worth another contract in two years. If his 2009 and 2010 are exactly as good as his 2005 and 2006 or his 2007 and 2008 were, the Twins will more than get their money back.

We released Mike Lamb with a year left on his contract, and are now paying him to sit on the bench for the Brewers. I know that happened during the season, but I want to point it out for this reason: he was the most expensive free agent acquisition in the history of the Twins franchise. In what sense is that not embarrassing?

We let Adam Everett walk in free agency, and he went to the Tigers. Everett came to the Twins along with a bunch of raving from the statistical community about his stellar defense. Unfortunately, he was injured most of the season and when he "toughed it up" and got onto the field, his arm was too weak to make the throw to first base. He was a cheap mistake, and letting him go is no big deal.

We did not sign any mediocre veteran starting pitchers. This is a huge step forward.

In addressing the hole at third base, we did not do very well. We balked at Casey Blake's asking price and let him go to the Dodgers. We balked at Ty Wigginton's demands for Blake-money, and let him sign with Baltimore for less-than-Lamb money. We balked at the Cubs' demands for Mark Derosa, and let them trade him to the Indians for peanuts. We balked at Joe Crede's demands to be paid like an All Star rather than an injury-riddled uncertainty. It appears the Twins are comfortable not spending money on third base and going with a Buscher/Harris platoon. They're justifying this now by saying that Buscher is really hitting the cover off the ball in batting practice; I'll point out that everyone said Buscher really hit the cover off the ball in Spring Training batting practice last year. It's time for him to prove he deserves to be around.

The other major hole on the team was late inning relief; the team needs a reliable setup man to act as a bridge to Nathan. Unwilling to give up a draft pick, the Twins threw the names of all Type A (ie, "good") free agents out the window and began hunting for bargains. It is not clear where exactly they were looking while bargain deals were being signed all winter by the likes of Affeldt and Nelson and others, but we finally settled on looking at Eric Gagne. We decided his demands for $3M were too much, and walked away from the table; days later he signed a minor league contract with the Brewers. We ended up signing Luis Ayala to a $1.3M deal that is <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/02/19/thursday-morning-update/">apparently not guaranteed</a>. It is completely unclear how Ayala will improve the late inning relief situation.

In order to make room for Ayala on the 40 man roster (a spot he may not even have a few weeks from now), the Twins put Bobby Korecky on waivers, and he was claimed by the Diamondbacks yesterday. Korecky had contributed -0.1 wins in 2008, but had had success in the minors and appeared to be ready to make some minor contributions. While it's not a huge deal to lose a 29 year old non-prospect who's performed below replacement level in the majors, it seems wrong to lose him for nothing.

And that's where we are right now. Through all these moves, the team has improved by 0.7 wins (almost all the improvement is Mike Lamb being gone -- he was worth -1.3 wins last year). That improvement is dwarfed by what could have been: +1.9 wins for Crede, +2.5 wins for Blake, +3.0 wins for Wigginton, +3.8 wins for Derosa. (Of course, Blake, Wigginton, and Derosa are almost sure to fail to live up to the expectations they set in 2008 and may never again reach those levels of performance. And Crede could either surpass those numbers or get injured and produce close to nothing. The Twins have never been one for big risks.)

Ultimately, the Twins are where they had hoped to be at the beginning of the offseason: hoping for continued excellence from Mauer and Morneau, a good bounceback season from Cuddyer and Liriano, and a strong step forward from several of the talented young players on the roster. It is by no means a <em>bad</em> place to be -- there are plenty of teams where you can look over the roster and pick out a few guys who simply shouldn't be on the team, and the Twins really aren't there. We have guys who may not work out and may not deserve to be in the majors, but they haven't proven it yet.

It was an offseason of standing in place and looking forward to the next season. I appreciate that, but it's been going on long enough. It's time to take this offseason to the glue factory and get to some baseball.
