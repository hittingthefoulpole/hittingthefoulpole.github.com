This morning, Buster Olney went over all the teams in the majors and highlighted their <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3883218&amp;searchName=olney_buster&amp;campaign=rsssrch&amp;source=olney_buster">positions of interest</a>. For most teams, he focused on what they need to add, or what's going to be a problem for them (ie, the Yankees are starting Melky Cabrera at CF, and the Red Sox have Varitek at C). But, for the Twins, it was a slightly different story.
<blockquote><strong>Minnesota Twins: Outfield, designated hitter</strong>
Twins GM <strong>Bill Smith</strong> broke down the competition for playing time in an e-mail: "We have five established players for three outfield spots and the DH -- <strong>Michael Cuddyer</strong>,<strong>Carlos Gomez</strong>, <strong>Jason Kubel</strong>, <strong>Denard Span</strong> and <strong>Delmon Young</strong>. They give us depth and versatility … three right-handed hitters and two left-handed hitters, and a combination of speed and power. [Manager <strong>Ron Gardenhire</strong>] will make the decisions on lineups and positions. It poses a challenge to keep everyone happy and playing, but it also gives us depth in the case of an injury."</blockquote>
This is nothing we haven't heard (and discussed) before. But I think it's telling that the team's biggest "problem" this offseason is that we have a bunch of good players and no extremely pressing needs.

"We have depth in case of injury" is <em>not</em> a problem for the fans to get worked up about.

"We have a handedness-based platoon at third base" is <em>not</em> a problem to get worked up about.

"We're not going to get offensive production out of our shortstop" is <em>not</em> a problem to get worked up about. (Just about nobody gets offense from SS. Don't sweat Punto that much as long as he's holding his own. He doesn't have to be Joe Mauer to be successful.)

"We have at least five starters who we want in the rotation" is <em>not</em> a problem.

"We're not wasting money" is <em>not</em> a problem.

So our main problem, according to Olney, is that we have one too many OF/DH players that should be starting, and that we have to trust Gardy's decision-making. (Based on playing time for Delmon and Kubel, I am very afraid of having to trust Gardy's decision-making, given that he hates both these guys.)

What about the White Sox?
<blockquote><strong>Chicago White Sox: Starting pitcher</strong>
The White Sox are counting on <strong>Mark Buehrle</strong>, <strong>John Danks</strong> and <strong>Gavin Floyd</strong> to man three-fifths of their rotation, and they like what they've seen out of <strong>Bartolo Colon</strong>. But they need someone to emerge at the back end.</blockquote>
So they're short a starter and <em>are relying on Bartolo Colon to actually pitch well for a full season</em>. You're kidding, right? Having 3/5 of a rotation is a pretty significant problem; it wouldn't be so bad if they had anyone in the high minors, but Danks and Floyd were just harvested and they've unloaded all their pitching prospects in the last year or two to acquire Swisher and Quentin. Especially in their home park, they're going to be struggling with run prevention 2 out of every 5 days.

Or the Tigers?
<blockquote><strong>Detroit Tigers: Starting rotation</strong>
Tigers GM <strong>Dave Dombrowski</strong> said recently that he feels good about the depth he has in starting pitchers and could conceivably have so much that he can make a trade. Among those in the running for the No. 4 and No. 5 slots in the rotation: <strong>Armando Galarraga</strong>, <strong>Zach Miner</strong> and a supposedly slimmer <strong>Dontrelle Willis</strong>.</blockquote>
Galarraga's pretty good, but the Tigers and their $120M+ payroll will be relying on Zach Miner and <em>Dontrelle Willis</em> to hold down a spot in their rotation. Is Dave Dombrowski the only person who thinks that's going to go well (or is, in some sense, considered "depth")? Or has someone else lost their mind?
<blockquote><strong>Cleveland Indians: Starting pitcher</strong>
The back end of the Indians' rotation could be a problem area, but the Indians don't lack for candidates behind No. 1 starter <strong>Cliff Lee</strong> and No. 2 starter <strong>Fausto Carmona</strong> --<strong>Aaron Laffey</strong>, <strong>Jeremy Sowers</strong>, <strong>Carl Pavano</strong>, <strong>Anthony Reyes</strong> and <strong>David Huff</strong> are all going to get chances to distinguish themselves in spring training.</blockquote>
Behind the top two in their rotation, they have a bunch of spare parts that will be fighting it out. And does anyone really think Cliff Lee is going to win another Cy Young award?

This is why I'm not freaking out. All the other contenders in our division are struggling to find starting pitchers, while we're pitching-rich. And pitching is hugely important.

Compared to "We only have three starters," or "We only have four starters," or "We only have <em>two</em> starters," well, "We have four outfielders" just doesn't sound so bad.
