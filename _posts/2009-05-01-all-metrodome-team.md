FSN has been running a promo or something related to an all Metrodome team.  This would be comprised of players who played for the Twins while they were in the dome.  Bert Blyleven, for example, technically would be eligible, but his best Twins years were pre-1982.  So, I will unveil the unofficial firegardy.com Metrodome team.  Note: nowhere will you find Nick Punto or Michael Cuddyer. Just sayin.

<strong>Starting Pitchers</strong>  (I'm going to pick three): Johan Santana, Frank Viola, Scott Erickson.  The first two are obvious choices as they won CY Young awards with the Twins, and were both pretty dominant.  I picked Erickson because he was instrumental in the 91 World Series, he threw a no-hitter at the dome, and sported a sweet mullet.

<strong>Catcher</strong>: Joe Mauer.  He is probably the best catcher the Twins have ever had.  He only has played a few years in the Dome, and some might think Brian Harper is a better choice since he won a World Series.  Mauer has two batting titles, finished pretty high in MVP voting, has a Gold Glove, and is still only 26. 

<strong>First Base</strong>: Gotta go with Hrbek here.  Two championships, and a pretty solid career top to bottom. Good defender at first, great hitter.  His career average is 282, his career OPS+ is 128.  All very good.

<strong>Second Base</strong>: Chuck Knoblauch.  Rookie of the year, gold glove caliber secondbase (before we traded him), excellent leadoff man.  He provided a great spark for that 91 team.  Too bad every Twins team he was on sucked, outside of 91 of course.

<strong>Thirdbase</strong>: Gary Gaetti.  The Rat provided power at the hot corner that the Twins have yet to replicate.  He had back to back 30 homer years in 86 and 87.  One of only two Dome era Twins players to do that, Justin Morneau being the other.

<strong>Shortstop</strong>: Greg Gagne. While not an huge offensive threat (what shortstop was in this era, Ripken maybe) Gagne was on both World Series teams.  He also hit two inside the park homers in one game at the dome in 1986. So that's cool.  Gagne left the team on bad terms in 92 when we paid Puckett a huge contract and were unable to afford what Gagne thought he was worth.  Oh well, he was a great shortstop to have when we had him.

<strong>Outfield</strong>: Kirby Puckett, Torii Hunter, Dan Gladden.  This is a tougher one.  The first two are obvious.  For the third you could make a case for several players, including Tom Brunansky, or Shane Mack.  As usual, the mullet is  the tie-breaker.

<strong>Bullpen</strong>: (I'm going with two) Rick Aguilera and Jeff Reardon.  These are two pretty obvious choices as they were the closers for the 91 and 87 teams.  Reardon only played for the Twins for three years, but in those years he had save totals of 31-42-31.  He had an ERA+ of 164 in 1988, that is very good.  Aguilera stepped in to replace Reardon and the bullpen didn't skip a beat. His ERA+ of 182 in 1991 basically meant if we got to the ninth, we were going to win.  From 1990-94 he had save totals of: 32-42-41-34-23.   He was then traded to Boston midway through 1995.  But came back in 1996 with moderate success.  Those teams were pretty bad so it is hard to expect much out of a closer on a terrible team.

I'm going to forego bench players. 

As you may have noticed there are a lot of players from good Twins teams.  When the Twins were bad, they obviously didn't have many good players.  I WANTED to pick Scott Stahoviak and Ron Coomer, but I just couldn't. 

What is your "All Dome Team"?
