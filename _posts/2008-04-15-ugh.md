This was the worst game of the year so far. We manage to score 9 runs, and lose. We blew 2 5 run leads. The offense and the pitching looked good for the first few innings. Even after we gave up 4 runs to make it a 5-4 game, we got all 4 of those runs back.  Which is something we wouldn't have done in the past.

What really irked me was allowing Punto to hit with the tying run on first. I understand he ALMOST hit a double to tie the game, but that does not excuse the fact that Gardy made a poor call. 

On the bright side, we did score 9 runs. That shows how bad the Tigers pitching is. I'm worried this will give them lots of momentum. We need to beat them tonight. To paraphrase Ivan Drago "We must break them".
