Well, Gardy's kicked it up a notch in his Delmon-hating game. <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/sinker/2008/12/04/gardys-outfield-guys-denard-gomez-and/">According to Sinker</a>, Gardy wants a starting outfield in 2009 of Gomez, Span, and Cuddyer. That leaves Delmon on the outs, obviously.

Aside from the obvious problem of actively dangling him on the trade market, having the manager basically come out and say that he's useless to us cannot help his trade value. And having him in a DH platoon with Kubel is terrible for many reasons -- the top two of which are that they both need 500+ AB. #3 is that Delmon is 23 years old, and it seems a little early to relegate him to a bench role given his obvious talents.
<blockquote>“Those three guys need to play every day. Delmon is in the mix. He’s a hell of a player, a hell of a talent. But to me, those three guys should be your outfield and then you go from there.”</blockquote>
What a twit. How can you say, with a straight face, that you think Delmon is a hell of a player, and immediately follow it up by saying he has absolutely no chance to play? Let me fix that for you:
<blockquote>"Delmon is in the mix. He's a hell of a player, a hell of a talent. But to me, he should be in your outfield, and then you go from there."</blockquote>
There. Isn't that better?

Furthermore, I simply don't understand Gardy's apparent refusal to accept depth in the outfield. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: it's a damn good thing we had four good outfielders last year, given that they kept getting injured (especially the oldest and least talented of the group, a certain Michael Cuddyer). If we decide not to learn from our <em>immediate</em> history, we could run into the exact same problem and see a bunch of Pridie and Kubel (and Punto?) stumbling around in the outfield, and I don't think anybody wants to see that.

Also, I just saw word from LEN3 that <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2008/12/04/twins-were-in-on-mike-lincoln/">Delmon's been hitting the weight room</a> since the season ended, and that he's lost weight. It seems to me that nobody expected Delmon to lose any weight -- all the jokes have been about the size of brother Dmitri. But this leaves open the possibility that Delmon will get both faster and stronger, in addition to more experienced and skilled at the plate. How come everyone's willing to wait for Mauer to develop into his power, but are willing to give up on Delmon's, despite the fact that Delmon already has more power, has the build of a big time power hitter, and is three years his junior?

Damn it, you Twins. Drop this talk about Blake and his elderly, overpriced ass. We're not running the Social Security program, we're running a baseball team. We don't need to sign a 35 year old mediocre player to a multi-year deal. We also don't need to sign the biggest free agent contract in franchise history for a second consecutive year <em>at the same position</em>, this time targeting a guy who is <em>even older</em>. If you feel like you have too many outfielders, then move Cuddyer to third base to lessen the logjam. And then be happy when Gomez tweaks his groin prancing around in center like a deer, or Span hurts his shoulder diving over the fence after a ball, or Delmon strains his oblique chasing after a slider six feet off the plate; "happy" because we have another real outfielder to use, rather than having traded one of them away for pennies on the dollar just so Gardy doesn't have to make tough decisions like "which one of these good players should play today?" and can instead make tough decisions like "which one of these <em>bad</em> players do I have to start today?"

(Oh, and in other interesting news, Adam Dunn has apparently also been hitting the weight room, and has lost 15 pounds. He's also projected to make less than $10M per year on the free agent market, due to the economy. He also wasn't offered arbitration, so there are no draft picks involved. I know I want Kubel to play, but a .380 OBP and 40 HR from the DH spot, with the "ability" to fill in occasionally at LF and 1B are calling out to me. Also, Mauer-Morneau-Dunn is a pretty fearsome 2-3-4 or 3-4-5 in any lineup. Also, Dunn hasn't been linked to the Twins in any rumor, and left handed hitters aren't exactly our need, and we already have a left handed LF/DH. But I don't see why we shouldn't consider Dunn if the price is right.)
