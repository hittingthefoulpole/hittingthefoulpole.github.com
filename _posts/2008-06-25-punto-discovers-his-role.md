It appears that Punto's time off has been good for him. He has taken a step back and gotten some perspective on his actual role with the team.

So, now that he's back, what is that role?
<blockquote>"We're playing pretty good. I'll just sit there and try to stay out of it," Punto said. "I'm a hand-shaker tonight." <a href="http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_9686905?nclick_check=1">(Near the bottom.)</a></blockquote>
Excellent. Punto finally understands that his role on this team is not to play, but to hide in a corner and let the other players play. And then shake their hands after they win.

This may be the best thing Punto has ever said or done in his entire career.
