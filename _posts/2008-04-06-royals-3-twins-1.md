The offensive woes continued as the Twins lost a close game to the Royals. Boof looked solid, but again received little run support. The lone run came on a Morneau homer in the 6th. It was a moonshot to the upper deck in right. We seemed to get most of our hits with two outs, and stranded lots of guys. Denard Span made his debut and didn't look terrible. Tolbert has continued to impress me, but I still think he role should be that of a utility player.  Its good to see Morneau hitting the ball hard. Kubel also stung the ball pretty good.  Harris made a nice play at second as well.  Gomez made another bonehead play when he singled to shallow right and decided he should try for a double. Gomez totally could have stolen second pretty easily, so I don't think he should have taken the risk to try to stretch it to a double. I blame Scott Ulger.We still seem to have a problem with stranding runners, and getting the leadoff man on base.  I also don't like to have the bottom of the order leading off innings constantly. I know it is very difficult to prevent this, but it is possibly to minimize it.  We have a lot of division games coming up, going to chicago tomorrow, and then KC next weekend, with a trip to Detroit after that. This is a perfect time to rack up wins within the division. Detroit is struggling, and Cleveland seems to be starting slowly. Here's to hoping for a successful first road trip.
