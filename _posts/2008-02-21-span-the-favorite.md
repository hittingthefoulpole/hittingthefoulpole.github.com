Denard Span, the former first round draft pick and heir apparent to Torii, <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080220&amp;content_id=2381905&amp;vkey=spt2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min">claims he has what it takes to be the starting center fielder</a>.  He doesn't.  Of the three candidates competing, Gomez, Pridie, and Span, Span is by far the worst.  None of the three are major league ready in my opinion.  So when you are significantly worse than your below average competition, you should just shut up.  I appreciate that he is going to give 110% and all the jazz, but was he not trying to make the big club in years past?  Could he not beat out Lew Ford and Jason Tyner for the 4th outfielder spot the past few year?  Did the likes of Darnell McDonald and Garrett Jones deserve late season call-ups more than Span? Yes they did.  Span has not once played at the Major League level.  The twins have recently had a severe lack of position player depth in the minors and Span couldn't even compete with these scrubs for a late season roster spot.  When Hunter got hurt in 2005 and missed most of the second half, Span's name wasn't even whispered to be called up for a look.  I just don't think he has what it takes, and he needs to be written off as a bust.
