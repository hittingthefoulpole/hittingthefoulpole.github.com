While perusing the Twins section of the startribune website this morning, I came across Joe C's Twins offseason <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/69535467.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUqCP:iUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr">to-do list</a>.  I glanced over it and it made sense to me.  Extend Mauer's contract, find someone to play third, etc.  All pretty standard stuff.  Then I noticed what #2 said:
<blockquote><strong>2</strong>Explore trades for an ace, such as Josh Johnson or Roy Halladay.</blockquote>
Roy Halladay?  The same guy who nobody was able to trade for last summer due to JP Riccardi's incompetence.  I can kind of understand Josh Johnson because he plays for the Marlins and will soon be making more than league minimum, therefore there is no place for him in Miami.  But Halladay?  Are we just throwing names of good pitchers out there?  Very unlike Joe C to petition for the Twins to make a fantasy baseball type move.

In other somewhat related news, the Phillies have <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4636078">declined</a> <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1112&amp;position=3B">Pedro Feliz's </a>option. I haven't done a ton of research on him, but does anyone think he might be a decent option for a year or two?  His hitting line doesn't jump out at me, and he is middle of the pack defensively.  Both of those things are better than most of what we have had at third over the years. Obviously I'm not saying lets go out and sign him today, but rather let's add him to the list of possibilities.  Which is pretty short at this point. If one of the options is re-sign Joe Crede and his impressive injury history, you know its slim pickings.

The JJ Hardy trade has been sufficiently covered by pretty much everyone in our blogroll, and by us.  Get up to date <a href="http://firegardy.com/2009/11/06/making-a-deal-twins-trade-gomez-for-hardy/">here</a> and <a href="http://firegardy.com/2009/11/07/what-theyre-saying-the-hardy-trade/">here</a>
