Without further ado, our LCS results.

ALCS:
<blockquote><em>sirsean: Rays in Six
FunBobby: Rays in Six
Spangler: Red Sox in Five
Reality: Rays in Seven</em></blockquote>
sirsean and I each picked up half a point for getting the team correct, but we were off on the number of games.  Higgins decided not to participate, but I'm guessing he would have picked the Rays due to his hatred  of the Red Sox. 

Overall the AL teams gave us a good series.  We saw great pitching and great hitting, and amazing comeback, and the second worst stadium in the American League.  Oh yeah, and cowbells.  Lots and lots of cowbells.  David Ortiz also only decided to show up for about two at bats,  and JD Drew again earned his paycheck with one good game.

Turns out the decision to set up Lester for game 7 worked out.  Although he and Beckett were both rocked once, and pitched well once.  Same goes for Dice-K. Tim Wakefield is bad.

NLCS:
<blockquote><em>sirsean: Dodgers in Five
FunBobby: Dodgers in Six
Spangler: Phillies in Five
Reality: Phillies in Five</em>

<em></em></blockquote>
Spangler once again used his NL prowess to hit this one right on the head and earn a full point, while the people who actually "work" here were about as wrong as possible.

This was kind of a ho-hum series. The Phillies let the Dodgers have one, but they made it look easy.  Or the dodgers made it look really difficult.  For how impressive they were in the NLDS against the team claiming to be the Cubs, they looked equally unimpressive against the Phillies.

We'll be back tomorrow (maybe) with the World Series post.  To recap, Spangler once again puts us to shame with his abilities to pick winners.  We should start having him pick gambling lines or something, we should be able to exploit this and profit from him.
