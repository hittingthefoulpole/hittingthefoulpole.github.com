So, the Twins are in first place.  Thanks to Brian Roberts.  So we enter the first of two August series with the White Sox tied for first place.  We have to remember, it is still only August.  Even if we lose two of three, we're only a game out.  If we sweep we are only three games up, etc.  Obviously every game from here on out is very important, but I fully expect my twitter feed to blow up with "the sky is falling" comments every time a reliever puts a man on base. Trust me, this will be annoying, and I will probably be a little guilty of it too.  So everyone, relax. 

I'm not too thrilled about Perkins starting on Wednesday, but I have no problem with Pavano or Liriano asking for an extra day. They have both been studs, and deserve a little extra rest in order to continue being studs down the stretch.  The White Sox are throwing Garcia/Danks/Floyd, which is pretty good for them.  We counter with Baker/Perkins/Liriano.  Outside of Liriano I have no idea what to expect.  As we all know Baker is a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde pitcher, and Perkins has been hit or miss in AAA.  Thankfully the Sox lineup isn't much better than your average AAA team.

We will be repeating these exact same steps next week, with an off day monday followed by a three game series against Chicago.  So to quote Hawk Harrellson, "sit back, relax and strap it down".  

You know, I never understood what he meant by that.  Strap what down? Apparently he has a new catchphrase,  "don't stop now, boys". So those of you who get to/have to watch the White Sox broadcast look out for it, and tell me if it ever fits into the context of the game.  I can't imagine it ever does.  

Also, Sean has put together the old FireGardy.com archives into a downloadble kindle product on amazon, so if you feel like shelling out $2.99 to read it on your Kindles, head over to amazon and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/FireGardy-com-Archives-Unabridged-Uncut-ebook/dp/B003Y3BP72/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&amp;qid=1281447023&amp;sr=1-2-fkmr1"> download it.</a>
