There has to be some reason, some event or series of events in Gardy's past, that he continues to play "scrappy" (read: all glove, negative bat) players instead of more qualified, well rounded players.  Well, I think I have figured it out.  In Gardy's brief stint with the Mets he was basically Nick Punto, except his manager was good and never let him play.  He was always a defensive sub and emergency fill-in at several positions. This type of player is very important on a team when used correctly.  I think deep down Gardy resents the fact that he wasn't good enough to be an everyday player, and despises the good players who started over him.  He is now living vicariously through Punto and trying to recapture the ABs he never got as a player.  Now promising young players like Casilla, and Brandon Harris will lose time at the  middle infield positions because Punto will steal their ABs.  This is like when you were in little league and you had to sit on the bench or play that crappy 4th outfield position because the coach wanted to let his son start at a key defensive position and bat high in the lineup even though he has no business being on the field.

 I want to bring up an important point to the readers here at firegardy.com.  Some people have been complaining about the signing of Adam Everett, stating that he is just like Nick Punto.  The one thing that makes him an asset rather than the liability that Punto is, is his ability to make productive outs, such as bunting, moving runners over, etc.  Punto brings a great glove that will help the team, and a bat that will help the opposing team.  On the flipside, Everett brings the same, if not better, glove, and a bat that will help his team.   Also, some of those plays that Punto makes are probably easier than they look.  Just because he runs hard after a foul pop doesn't mean he is a great defender. A great defender makes hard plays look easy, he doesn't make easy plays look hard. That might be a sign of a bad defender.
