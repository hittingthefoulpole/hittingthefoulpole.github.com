In his first relief appearance I thought, "Man, maybe Boof has actually turned a corner and can thrive in a middle-long relief role".  I was wrong.  He continues to look lost on the mound.  This makes me sad because I've always liked him, but it seems we must face the cold, cruel dawn and realize that maybe he just isn't going to thrive as a big league pitcher.  Could he pitch while down the line for a different team? Probably.  When Liriano comes back later this summer, I think the twins need to do one of two things: Cut Livan or Cut Boof.  Boof has more upside, and Livan isn't going to be on the team next year anyway, so that seems like the logical choice.  I was hoping he would pitch well until the end of summer and we could trade him at the deadline for more than a bucket of baseballs, but sadly that is about all he is worth now.  I would rather keep Boof than Livan, but one of them will most likely be out when Liriano eventually returns. Another reason Livan makes sense is because we have to essentially make two roster moves. 1)Take a guy off the 25 man roster, and 2) Remove a guy from the rotation. If we get rid of Livan that kills two birds with one stone so to speak. Cutting Livan is even more essential if we fall out of the playoff race before the deadline. What is the point of having a terrible pitcher on the team who isn't part of the future plans.  I know Gardy likes having guys with "veteran" status, but who really cares.  Sometimes I think Gardy would take a bad veteran over a good inexperienced guy. I hope that isn't true, but he could prove it is later this summer by keeping Livan when everyone knows he shouldn't.  The way I see it, the guys who are most likely to be sent down (or cut) when Liriano comes back are the following: 
<ol>
	<li>Livan</li>
	<li>Boof</li>
	<li>Brian Bass</li>
	<li>Breslow</li>
	<li>Bobby Korecky</li>
</ol>
That is in no particular order, but its pretty close to most to least likely. Korecky and Breslow have been quite effective, Bass has been forgettable but not terrible, and the first two have been pretty close to terrible. The reason I have limited it to pitchers is because the team seems set to have 12 pitchers. Also, with Nick Punto due back soon, I assume that Buscher will be the casuality when he comes back. If anyone has more creative method of shuffling the roster in the coming weeks/monhts, please, share.
