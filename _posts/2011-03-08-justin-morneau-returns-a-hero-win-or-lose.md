**UPDATE:** Morneau went 1-2 with a double and 3 RBI. The double came with the bases loaded, it cleared the bases, and was apparently an absolute rocket down the line. He was all smiles.

Good news, everyone: **Justin Morneau is playing in a game today.** He's getting into a B game against the Pirates, but whether it's A or B, or the opponent, or whether the team wins or loses, or whether he gets a hit or not, these things are utterly unimportant to the biggest, best news so far in 2011. Justin Morneau has been cleared to play in baseball games, and he's getting back onto the field. [Joe Christensen was first with the news](http://twitter.com/JoeCStrib/status/45132577941630976), and was quickly followed by [the official announcement by the official Minnesota Twins Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/MinnesotaTwins/status/45133439040634880). Phil Mackey says that the announcement is [not official yet](http://twitter.com/PMac21/status/45134790973857793), but that doesn't mean it's wrong to get excited.

No, it's right and good. Get excited.

This has been a serious concussion -- it didn't seem like it would be at first, but the thing about concussions is that you can't tell and you never know. Having suffered my share of concussions, I am pulling for Morneau in a way that I never have before even as he established himself as one of the stars of the league for my favorite team.

I always root for comeback stories.* Josh Hamilton's was a good one, and it has been fun to root for him to ascend to stardom from the depths he found. But Morneau is different. He didn't choose to plumb those depths, they were instead thrust upon him. And perhaps most importantly, for me, is that I can relate to what he's going through in a way that I simply cannot for a guy like Hamilton.

_* I believe that's common among Americans._

It's still springtime, and so it's still time to dream. With the sun shining brightly in the middle of an impossibly blue sky in the Fort Myers of my mind's eye, I can still hope that Morneau steps into the box and hasn't missed a beat. That he can return and be the .345/.437/.618 monster he was last year before he went down. That he will punish those baseballs that got a reprieve from his menacing bat for all these months. That the perceived front office missteps this offseason won't matter as long Morneau is in the lineup making opposing pitchers quiver in their cleats.

Whatever Morneau says about not needing much time to prepare for the season, I know there will be setbacks and unpromising days. I know there will be 0-for-4 days, probably several. But spring training, while a beautiful thing, doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how he does in these games.

What matters is that he's in them. For today, that's enough.

And for everyone who has struggled to recover from concussions, this is a lot bigger than baseball.

For them, this is about their lives. And win or lose, Morneau has a chance to be a hero.

[Sid Hartman has an article up today with plenty of Morneau quotes](http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/117500018.html) that finally make it sound like he's close to recovery. Enjoy.

> "We've had more good days than bad days," Morneau said Sunday. "I don't know, what we're waiting for it's got to be a week of good days or whatever it is, so we're still waiting for that.

> "We haven't quite gotten to that point yet but it's been real minimal now. If there's anything, on a scale of 1-10, [the severity of the effects is] a one. We haven't had any days like we had back in September or October or November where I didn't feel like doing anything and if I had a headache I was laying in bed, that type of thing. It's been good."

> "I think I'd be lying if I said the answer to that was no," he said. "When I got hit in the head in '05 [at Seattle], every once in a while I stepped in against a lefty and it would be in the back of my mind. I got over it over a little bit of time and things started to feel better and it was to a point where I didn't even think about it. I'm sure it will take a little bit of time but we'll get over that point. That's why we're going to wait until it's 100 percent so we're not worried about that stuff and I can be the hitter that I'm used to being."

> "It's close now. Just making sure we're doing it right," Morneau said. "We don't want to come back too soon and then all of a sudden some stuff creeps back up and then we get set back. We want to come back, we want to come back fully 100 percent and not have any setbacks and not have any concerns of if we slide in or if we get hit by a pitch or whatever it is. They tell me when I'm recovered, I'm recovered, and if it happens again it's a new injury and we'll know better how to treat it."

> "I've been doing everything down here [in Florida] that I normally do in spring training, I just haven't played in any games yet," he said. "This is the last hurdle we have to clear and we still got time. Personally, I feel like I only need about two weeks' of at-bats to get ready for the season, and even 10 days might be pushing it, but that will be close. And if we can go down to the minor league side and it's a little more lax down there, I can lead off every inning if I want to get nine at-bats in a game or stuff like that. There's ways to get me ready if I need to get ready."

> "If I was 21 or 22 I think I'd be a little bit more worried or concerned about my timing and all the rest of it," he said. "But I've been around and I've had a lot of at-bats now in the big leagues, and I feel like my swing is what it is. It's kind of to the point where mechanically, it is what it is, and it will just be the timing that needs to come.

> "Like I said, those two weeks or 40 at-bats, or whatever number you want to put on it, I think that's how long it will take, and once we get to that point, I think my swing is what it is and I'm pretty confident in that."
