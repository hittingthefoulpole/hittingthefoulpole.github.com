<a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/82461722.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUUULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr">Joe C is reporting</a>that the Twins are hot on the trail of free agent DH/Twin Killer <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=409&amp;position=1B/DH">Jim Thome</a>.  When I first read this story I was confused.  The Twins already have a DH who cannot hit lefties.  What would we need Thome for?  He made $13 million last year,  so how much of a pay cut can be expected? Would he really be willing to accept a bench role?

<a href="http://aarongleeman.com/">Aaron Gleeman </a>opines that he platoon at DH with Young while Kuble takes most of the reps in left. I wouldn't mind seeing that happen, Thome hits righties too well to be a bench player. While Young is pretty terrible at everything. The biggest question at this point has to be his price tag. The Twins payroll already looks to be in the $90 million range with gaping holes in the infield. Would Thome accept a pay cut down to the $1 million range? I don't know which AL teams have a hole at DH, but it seems like a team like the Yankees or Red Sox can give Thome more money to do the same job. 

I like the thinking that the Twins need to upgrade their bench, but I don't think the price on Thome will come down to the point where it is worth it to sign him as a bench player.  If they are committed to giving him the bulk of DH at bats against righties, then I think they should go for it.  Given the current payroll level and glaring holes elsewhere, maybe we are better off going after someone like Ryan Garko as a bat off the bench.  Any money we have available should be put towards a second or thirdbaseman.

What do you guys think about Jim Thome in a Twins uniform?
