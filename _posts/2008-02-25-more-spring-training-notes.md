<ul>
	<li>Apparently Jesse Crain threw to real hitters for the first time since May.  I don't think it should count since those "hitters" were Nick Punto and Adam Everett.  Although kudos to the coaching staff for giving Crain a nice confidence boost.</li>
	<li>Kevin Slowey looked good in his first pitching session. Word is he was throwing really hard.  Harder than anyone has seen him throw before.  However, since the Twins don't use radar guns in camp nobody really knows how hard he was actuall throwing.</li>
	<li>Gardy officially made the call for Delmon Young to start in left, keeping Cuddyer in right. This is a smart move.  Make a note, because you can count on one hand how many times I will say Gardy made a smart move.</li>
	<li>The lineup for tuesdays first spring game is as follows:</li>
