Now, I'm not someone who gets tricked by flukish numbers often,* but [check this out](http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=4541868&name=olney_buster&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines):

> It has been nearly eight years since Rivera allowed a run in a postseason game at Yankee Stadium. His current postseason scoreless streak at home is 29 1/3 innings (the most by anyone ever in his home park). And in another amazing coincidence for an amazing pitcher, the first 29 1/3 postseason innings he threw at Yankee Stadium were scoreless as well. Here are the longest postseason scoreless-innings streaks at a home ballpark.

So he went 29.1 IP without giving up a run, gave some up, and then has gone exactly 29.1 IP since then without giving up a run? So you're telling me that the Twins will come back off Rivera on Friday night? I think that's what you're telling me.

_* Who am I kidding? Yes I am._

Additional fun numbers:

Rivera wears #42, and he's pitched 42 games at home in the postseason, and his ERA in those games is 0.42 (if you tried to make something like this up, people would laugh in your face).
