Ah ha! Remember all those times I harped on the fact that other teams and agents seem to be out to screw the Twins? Well, <a href="http://www.twins-territory.com/2009/february-2009/gagne-to-brewers.html">it continues to happen</a>.

After declining a $3M offer from the Twins, Eric Gagne turned around and signed a minor league contract with the Brewers. A non-guaranteed deal.

Are you <em>kidding me</em>?

This is not a case of the Twins "failing to spend enough money," or being bad at negotiations. This is simply a case of an agent and a player going out of their way to take an inferior deal from a less successful, inferior team rather than deal with the Twins.

Is there really anyone that thinks the Brewers are going anywhere this year after losing Sabathia and Sheets? This is not a case of a player choosing to go with the team it thinks has a better shot at the playoffs.

This is, simply, a bunch of crap. Why did we have to pay $1.3M for piece of crap Luis Ayala and guarantee him a spot on the team, when we could have spent &lt;$1M on piece of crap Eric Gagne (with the benefit of a modicum of upside) and <em>not</em> guarantee him a spot on the team? It had nothing to do with a failing on the part of the front office.

Maybe it's just me, like everything else seems to be, but this is infuriating.
