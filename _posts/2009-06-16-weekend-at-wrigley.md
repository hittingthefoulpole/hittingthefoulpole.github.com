I, along with apparently every other Twins fan, made the trek to Chicago over the weekend to watch the Twins play three games at Wrigley Field. I will admit, I really don't like the Cubs.  Not sure why.  I just don't.  However, taking in a game at Wrigley field is great.  We had phenomenal seats, provided by a college buddy of mine.  I was unable to watch the Milton Bradley game on Friday as I was traveling, but we watched the games on Saturday and Sunday. 

One of the reasons I find Wrigley field so much fun is there is a bunch of stuff to do (read: bars) around the stadium.  What do we have at the dome?  One bar, a hospital and a bunch of freeway entrance ramps. That's not fun. 

The game on Saturday was delayed, but it turned out to be a great day for baseball.  Not too hot, and the sun eventually came out.  My cubs fan buddy Mike (who provided the tickets) said the Twins were as impressive a traveling fan base as he had seen.  The Twins fans were loud, and not including me, not too obnoxious. 

So we take two out of three on the road.  I'm happy with that.   We really cannot lose any of the next six games at home.  Neither the Pirates nor the Astros are very good.  I think Perkins is back for his start on Thursday, and I am interested to see what the team does regarding Crain.  It is clear he can't be used in a game anymore.  He just doesn't have the ability to get major leaguers out.  Whether or not he can regain this ability is still TBD.
