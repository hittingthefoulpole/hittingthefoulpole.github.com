The hot stove season is heating up with Jake Peavy rumors running rampant around the NL, and speculation of what big names the Yankees and Red Sox will acquire this offseason.  Did anyone really think the Dodgers would part with Russell Martin?  Is that just another example of Red Sox fans assuming they can have any good young players they want?

As far as the Twins go, things have been relatively quiet compared to last year.  Garrett Atkins name has come up often, but I'm not really sold on that. <a href="http://aarongleeman.com">Gleeman </a>wrote a piece today on why it wouldn't be in the Twins best interest to acquire this slugger. The three main points I got out of it were a) he has decline every year since 2006, b)his home-road splits are quite drastic, and c) his defense is sub-par. All viable reasons, but Twins "fans" are clamoring for him because he is a big name and hits a fair amount of homers. All terrible reasons to want someone, especially since the price will be high.

Another name that keeps popping up is JJ Hardy.  I like the <em>idea</em> of getting Hardy, but again I think the price will be too high.  It will take at least one of our 2008 starting pitchers, plus 1-2 decent prospects.   Casey Blake is a viable option to play third base for a few years.  However, I do not think he is much of an upgrade of a Buscher-Harris platoon, and he will be drastically overpaid for some reason.  He is 35 and has been released by the Twins <em>twice</em>.  Outisde of Hardy I'm not sure who is available on the SS market.  I've always been a fan of moving Casilla to short, but I doubt Gardy will do that.  Another option for the left side of the infield is moving Cuddyer back to third.  I don't mind this move.  Its risky, and Cuddyer will have to be 100% willing to do it.  Any hesitation and you don't do it.  My biggest fear is that Gardy won't just plant him at third and leave him there.  If one of the outfielders needs a day off I can really see Gardy throwing cuddyer out there as a fill-in, this would be a terrible idea. 

If both of the moves abve are made, is Busher then your backup corner infielder and DH?  That seems like a fine role for him.  Who then plays second? Punto? Harris?  If casilla stays at second is Punto the full-time shortstop, with Harris getting some reps?  If Cuddyer stays in the outfield do we have Buscher/Harris at third and Punto at short?  Gardy and the front office have lots of decisions to make, and hopefully we'll be busy at the winter meetings. 

 If I had my way I would test the waters of moving Cuddyer to third, check the market for Hardy (and any other SS).  I don't think we should acquire a 3B, Cuddyer or Buscher/Harris (we will need to come up with a clever nickname for them) are both decent options.  SS is where we should look into getting a fresh body.  Punto shouldn't be allowed the be the everyday starter.

Thoughts?
