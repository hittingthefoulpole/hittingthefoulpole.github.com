Lets take a look at the Twins free agents and who they should keep, and who they should let walk.  I'm assumin the team will pick up the option on Mike Redmond, for a hair less than a million.

First up, Dennys Reyes. He made $1MM in 2008, and wasn't very good.  With the emergence of Craig Breslow and Jose Mijares there is no need for an overpriced lefty.  Let him walk.

Nick Punto.  Punto "earned" $2.4MM in 2008 and would probably require a small raise.  Still under $3MM, maybe $2.6 or $2.7.  That is too much for someone we can easily replace.  Tolbert and Harris are both utility players, no need to have a utility man who makes more money than our third and fourth best hitters combined (Kubel and Young, I don't know if that is actually true but its close, with Kubel making $1.3 and Young probably somewhere near league minimum, if you want to replace Young with Span go ahead, that numbers still work).  I think the Twins will re-sign him for somewhere close to $3MM and it will be a waste of money when Tolbert is nearly identical and millions cheaper.

Adam Everett. This one is a no brainer.  Goodbye.

Eddie Guardado. Again, I think this is a no brainer. I've already mentioned two lefties who are more effective, no need to carry three.  Eddie G made $2MM in 2008, no reason to pay him that.  Goodbye.

We are still on the hook for abour $2.6 of Mike Lamb's remaining contract.  and we will be paying about 7.65 million to our "under control" players.  Guerrier and Kubel are due moderate raises through arbitration, and Crain (1.7MM), Cuddyer (7.667MM), Mauer (10.5MM), Morneau (11.6MM) and Nathan (11.25MM) are all under contract.  This should be a much more low stress offseason.  Lets hope Wild Bill makes the right moves.
