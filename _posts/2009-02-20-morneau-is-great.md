<a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/39889092.html?page=2&amp;c=y">Justin Morneau is awesome</a>.
<blockquote>"I've told Joe [Mauer], if he ever leaves me, I'll never speak to him again," Morneau said. "We've got to get him signed to an extension."</blockquote>
That is a great sentiment, and hopefully Morneau's long contract and ever-growing clubhouse influence go a long way towards convincing the front office to start throwing sacks full of money in Mauer's direction.

Also, does anyone else find it slightly amusing that Mauer's former roommate phrased it that way?
