We all know that Gardy's a smart guy, and gives some brilliant quotes when asked nicely. I think <a href="http://bases.newsvine.com/_news/2009/04/25/2732565-potent-quotables-saturday?category=sports">he just topped himself</a>, though.
<blockquote>"He's got to unstink because it's not mechanical. OK? There you have it. That's managing 101."</blockquote>
That's managing 101? I mean, I never took that class, but I imagine that "he's got to unstink" isn't part of it.

He was talking about Baker and his early struggles. He's given up 7 homers in his first two starts, which ties him for the most given up in the first start of the season, <em>ever</em>.

At some point those balls are going to stop leaving the park,* but Baker's going to have to make the necessary adjustments: keep the ball down, and stop leaving fat ones middle up.

<em>* Also, at some point, Blyleven is going to have to admit that Baker is a homer-prone pitcher. No other pitcher has given up more home runs in his first two starts of the season, in the history of baseball. He gave up 20 HR in 28 games last year. This is simply a lot of home runs.</em>

But at least we have Gardy there to <em>not</em> do anything about it.
