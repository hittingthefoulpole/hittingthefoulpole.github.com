So, it's been pretty lightly reported that Punto was hit in the elbow by a pitch, while playing for Italy during the WBC. He's now back with the Twins, and is getting X-rays on the elbow to check it out. He'd already had them taken after the fateful game in Toronto, but now the swelling and pain is back so <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/03/12/thursday-update-punto-to-have-more-x-rays-on-elbow/">they're checking it out again</a>.
<blockquote>Nonetheless, Punto said he had an excellent time playing in the WBC, even better than he expected.</blockquote>
Oh, well that's good then. The Twins are, after all, paying Punto $4M per season so he can go out and have lots of fun playing for <em>other teams that are not the Twins</em> and then <em>getting hurt while doing it</em>.  

Now everyone knows I'm not the biggest Punto fan in the world, but he's a valuable player on our team* and I really don't want to see that wasted by his participation in a futile effort to help <em>Italy</em> win a ballgame. Seriously, Italy? They're so bad they think having Nick Punto as a starting shortstop is a good thing. Oh, wait. Scratch that last bit.

<em>* Or, as Brian Cashman would say, he's an asset that we want to get our money's worth out of. We need to protect our assets!</em>

Hopefully all is well with Punto's elbow, and we don't have to see too much of Tolbert and Machado doing their best Punto impressions.

And I continue to be opposed to any Twins players playing in the WBC. Just imagine if this were someone you cared about. Like Nathan, or Morneau.
