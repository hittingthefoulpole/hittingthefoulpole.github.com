Sorry for the complete lack of postings lately, both of us have been very busy.  I just got back from Vegas and was on the opposite side of the same hotel Paris Hilton was in when she got arrested for coke possession.  So that's cool. 

All season long it seems Austin Jackson and Neftali Feliz have been getting all the AL ROY hype, well they better make room for Danny Valencia.

Valencia was called up a few months back when Cuddyer had to go on the bereavement list, and it was expected that he wouldn't stick around.  He has been touted as the Twins thirdbaseman of the future, despite being not much more than a decent hitter, and average fielder in the minors.  Ever since Gardy installed him as the regular 3B in the middle of the summer he has been white hot.  After his walk-off single last night he is hitting a nifty 332/375/447 in 224 plate appearances.  He has played a very solid third base, showing good range, and a great arm.  His UZR/150 is 24.7, but that is next to meaningless due to the ever present "small sample size".

Detroit Tigers CF Austin Jackson is one of the other leading ROY candidates.  Along with playing spectacular defense in center, as witnessed last night, he is hitting 305/357/408 in 547 plate appearances.  While not as good as Valencia, he has had over twice as many PAs.  That might be enough to sway voters.  While Valencia plays solid, steady defense, Jackson provides more highlight reel catches. 

Feliz has been excellent closing games for the first place Rangers this year. He has notched 34 saves. His ERA isn't sparkling, 3.26, and it is right in line with his FIP (3.28).  His strikeout rate is good, 9.16, but I like to see closers hit the double digits there.  His WHIP is under 1.00, which is always good. 

If you held a gun to my head, I'd probably pick Jackson since he has been performing at a high level since day one.  Although the Twins and Rangers being in playoff contention in September certainly gives Valencia and Feliz bonus points.  I don't think the Twins would be in first place without Valencia's contributions.

What does everyone else think?
