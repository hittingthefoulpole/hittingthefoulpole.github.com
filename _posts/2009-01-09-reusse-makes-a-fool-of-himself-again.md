<a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/37241814.html">Patrick Reusse is a sad, cranky old man.</a>

What's making him sad and cranky these days? Well, it's the fact that Bill Smith isn't running around like a crazed, headless chicken, throwing dollars and prospects at everything that moves. In his recent article, Reusse spends the first 60% of his prose poking fun at the recently deceased Pohlad, knocking Smith for his reputation as Assistant GM, attempting to come up with lame new nicknames, and pointing out that the other AL Central teams are all destined to win the World Series in 2009 while the Twins go 0-162 -- after all, the Indians made a bunch of win-now moves, the Royals have made "moves that could give it a chance to keep moving forward from last season's lofty fourth-place finish" (ooh, I'm shaking in my boots), the Tigers keep moving backwards, and the White Sox have "have lost more assets than they have gained." Clearly, the Twins need to act afraid now, since those four teams have clearly improved themselves so much!

He bemoans the fact that we signed Nick Punto, because it wasn't enough -- more! He insults RA Dickey, as if he expects Gardy to roll into Opening Day with the old knuckleballer on the roster. Reusse wants moves! He wants Smith to make a fool of himself so he can point out why the moves won't work!
<blockquote>Smith flinched at giving a third year to free agent Casey Blake, an answer at third base. Smith flinched at exceeding the package of marginal prospects Cleveland sent to the Cubs for Mark DeRosa, a better answer at third.</blockquote>
Well, we've talked about this before, of course. Giving a third year to Blake would have been foolish, and the Dodgers will regret that. But they're more accustomed to making expensive mistakes with their roster -- hello, Juan Pierre and Andruw Jones -- while the Twins would rather avoid paying someone several million dollars when they're old and incapable of actually playing baseball. Weird. And the Cubs didn't give the Twins the chance to give them something between the Indians' miniscule package and the Slowey/Span/prospects deal they demanded from us -- that's not Smith's fault. And Derosa's a one year rental anyway. Does Reusse really think his career 97 OPS+ would look that great in our lineup?

Then we get to the true gold of the article. Reusse lists the possible options that Smith might have available to improve the team. With each one, he gives a surprisingly lucid explanation of why signing them would not work out or be in the Twins' interest or even be possible. Then, for each one, he accuses the Twins of being foolish, cheap, and afraid, due to the fact that they're not out there stupidly taking risks and spending money, for the sole purpose of creating news for Reusse to complain about. It's no wonder newspapers are going out of business. Patrick Reusse works at one.

I particularly love this line:
<blockquote>the Twins have missed on enough expensive first-rounders that an elite setup guy such as Cruz would be worth sitting it out this time.</blockquote>
Oh yes. It works on so many levels! The Twins have missed on a whole slew of "expensive" first-rounders -- like Torii Hunter, Jason Varitek (asshole), Todd Walker, Michael Cuddyer, Joe Mauer, Denard Span, Glen Perkins, Matt Garza, plus great current prospects Ben Revere and Aaron Hicks (who many scouts say may be the best talent in the minors right now). That's just a <em>terrible, unforgivably bad haul</em> for the first round. I mean, they're only batting .500 with their first round picks! All the other teams draft nothing but uber-prospects in the first round. In fact, I can't think of another team who has EVER drafted ANYBODY in the first round who didn't end up being a FUCKING SUPERSTAR. So yes, the Twins would be better off just <em>not trying to draft people any more</em>.

And also, Reusse was <em>just</em> talking about the fact that Cruz wouldn't even sign with us because he wouldn't be our closer. So it's not even relevant whether Reusse thinks we should sign the guy. It's a good thing we're talking about it!
<blockquote>On Tuesday, the Twins allowed themselves to be outbid (two years, $10 million) by Baltimore for Koji Uehara, a righthander from Japan.</blockquote>
I don't think I can handle it any more. You mean to tell me that the Minnesota Twins, with a rotation of 25-and-under players making the minimum (ie, the entire rotation costs $2.5M), all of whom have demonstrated at least some success in the majors, and an entire pipeline of another dozen top pitching prospects ready to step in if anyone falters, failed to outbid a team that has a shot at running out <em>the worst rotation of all time</em>? How did we let this happen? Also, why should we spend twice as much money on an unproven back-of-the-rotation Japanese guy than on <em>the entire rotation</em>, when <em>everyone else in the rotation is better than he is</em>? Who in blazes cares if Uehara went to Baltimore? Good for him! It just means that A-Rod and Longoria will be smashing home runs off him instead of Jim Thome and Miguel Cabrera.
<blockquote>Five weeks from spring training, Smith's second offseason needs to gather momentum to reach abysmal.</blockquote>
And thus, we're finished. I think it's been pretty conclusively demonstrated that doing stupid things that hurt the team is better than <em>not</em> doing stupid things. That's why this offseason has, somehow, been <em>worse than abysmal</em>. We should have given Casey Blake three years and more dollars! We should have traded Slowey and Span for Derosa! We should sacrifice our first round pick (which has a 50% chance of becoming a good major leaguer for us for a period of <em>six years</em>) in order to get our hands on an overpriced relief pitcher (who are by definition unpredictable and short-lived) for two or three years!

Failing to be a horseshit GM isn't much of a failure. Just saying.
