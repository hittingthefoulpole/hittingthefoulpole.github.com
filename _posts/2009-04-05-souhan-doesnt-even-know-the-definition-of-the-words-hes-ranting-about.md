I'm pretty sure the reason Jim Souhan and Patrick Reusse don't have RSS feeds for their online content is so that it's impossible to find -- and ridicule -- their articles. But I managed to find one, this time <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/42434257.html">from the desk of Souhan</a>, so it's time to have a little fun with it.

<strong>(Editor's note: Jim Souhan's column is unavailable today, so the Star Tribune instead will use this space to print an infomercial.)</strong>

Oh good, so we're going to get to see some interesting content then!

<strong>Hey, kids! Want to be a big-league hitter? For only three payments of $29.99, we'll show you how you, too, can make millions of dollars by doing nothing.</strong>

I see. It was a joke. An annoying tease to trick me into reading the article. Well, judging by this auspicious start, this will be a good one. I mean, what can go wrong with this concept?

<strong>Sound too good to be true? Then you haven't been paying attention to Major League Baseball, the only major sport in the world where millionaire athletes get paid to act like defense lawyers -- they stand still, look serious and occasionally argue.</strong>

Sometimes I think that the worst thing about baseball is that it turns its fans into crotchety old men who hate everything about it. Maybe that's not baseball, though. Maybe it's just senility.

<strong>Don't believe us? Then you haven't been paying attention. Once upon a time, baseball was ruled by fast, powerful athletes, guys who liked to steal bases and hit long home runs. I know, I might as well be telling you stories about dinosaurs, but it's true! Guys like Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle could have played quarterback, wide receiver or small forward, could have anchored a sprint relay team.</strong>

In case you were wondering, yes, I do need a ridiculous hook at the beginning of every single paragraph. If I don't get one, I don't know that there's something exciting and important coming up!

I'm a little confused by this, though. Is he somehow implying that players were more athletic forty years ago than they are today? I don't see it.

<strong>They went to the plate looking to do something spectacular. Well, thanks to pitch counts, times have changed. No longer do baseball games imitate Clint Eastwood movies, two hours of suspense punctuated by action. Now, baseball games are Robert Altman films, ensemble casts standing around talking and taking forever to get to the point</strong>.

So, here we have it. The thesis. The thing we're being sold in this "infomercial." Hitters aren't as exciting as they used to be, because their approach is boring and lawyer-y. And what's to blame? Pitch counts! Of course, why didn't I think of that?

Meanwhile, Eastwood and Altman? Are you deliberately trying to date yourself? Or is this a tacit acknowledgement of the fact that nobody under 50 bothers to subscribe to the newspaper any more?

<strong>Thanks to the Yankees and Oakland A's of the late 1990s, and the new-millennium Red Sox, pitch counts rule the game. Thanks to author Michael Lewis, the act of standing still watching pitches -- and hours -- go by is now romanticized.</strong>

You keep on saying "pitch count," as if you think pitchers should be throwing more pitches. But your entire complaint is that they're throwing too many pitches. I think you're a little confused.

<strong>The baseball filibuster is now in vogue.</strong>

That "paragraph" was fun. Whenever I come across a single non-sequitur sentence like that, sitting on its own in the middle of the article, it gives me the impression that the author came up with it on its own, and either needed an article to cram it into, or crafted an article around it just so he could use it. Somehow this line just didn't seem worth it.

<strong>This might be bad for fans, who need No-Doze to get through Yankee at-bats, and the help of both Dunn Bros. to get to the end of a World Series game, but it's great for you, the aspiring young baseball player.</strong>

Or you could, you know, watch Twins games or something. Instead of watching Yankees games, which you seem to hate. Also, I hope you didn't try to stay up for all of Game 5 last year.

<strong>Thanks to pitch counts, you, too, can become a big-leaguer, even if your greatest athletic asset is patience.</strong>

Yes, if only managers would leave their pitcher in to throw 150 pitches, children would stop being able to dream of someday growing up to be in the majors.

<strong>Here's the deal: The Yankees of the mid- to late '90s were not the bloated underachievers who now wear pinstripes. They were gamers such as the young Derek Jeter and the older Paul O'Neill, and their method of gamesmanship was the high pitch count.</strong>

Now I love a good fat joke as much as anyone, but this one kind of fizzled out before the punch line. Also, don't the "bloated underachievers" currently playing for the Yankees attempt to drive up the pitch count much in the same vein as the 90s Yankees? And aren't they pretty good at it? Isn't that what you've been complaining about this whole time?

<strong>We all know that the scarcest quantity in sports is quality pitching, and the softest underbelly in sports is middle relief. With O'Neill taking balls and fouling off strikes, with the Yankees intimidating umpires into giving them the benefit of the doubt on every close pitch, games grew longer than the recession.</strong>

So what you're saying is that everyone knows about the weaknesses of a pitching staff, and that the Yankees figured out a way to exploit that in a way that helped them win baseball games. Outrage!

But at least there's a timely reference to current events clumsily stuffed in here so we know you're still awake.

<strong>If you attended a Yankees game that started at 7:05, you had to be prepared for their opponent to be making its third pitching change in the sixth inning at 10 p.m.</strong>

Why would we be attending Yankees games? Isn't this the Minneapolis paper? You are aware that when the Yankees play the Twins, the game goes pretty quickly, right? I mean, the Twins pitchers throw strikes, which remains the best way to keep the games quick. So, given that you're supposed to be writing about the Twins, this is just about the last article that you should be writing. Right?

<strong>When good pitching was at its most scarce in the '90s, teams such as the Yankees and A's capitalized, adopting hitting philosophies that often didn't emphasize hitting.</strong>

Why was it at its most scarce then? I mean, wasn't that the era of Greg Maddux, Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, et cetera? I mean, those are four of the best pitchers of all time. I think you can argue that the late 90s was a period of good pitching rarely seen in the history of baseball.

And by the way, if "drawing walks" weren't part of hitting, why is it even possible? Why are there balls? Why is BB listed in the box score?

<strong>Those philosophies won titles for the Yankees and praise for the A's, whose general manager, Billy Beane, was immortalized in Lewis' book "Moneyball," in which Lewis portrayed Beane as a genius for drafting players based on on-base percentage and other vital but undervalued statistics.</strong>

Actually Lewis portrayed Beane as a genius for finding an inefficiency in the market for baseball players and exploiting it to field a competitive baseball team without the luxury of a large payroll. That there was anything inherent about OBP that Beane cared about is one of the most misunderstood aspects of the book.

<strong>The Red Sox hired statistical guru Bill James, adopted the every-at-bat-is-a-siege mentality, and won their first two World Series since 1918.</strong>

If only they hadn't done that, we could still make fun of the Red Sox for never winning the World Series, just like we do the Cubs. Instead, they're trying to do things that are smart, and as a result they look smart. I'm cold and scared.

<strong>Sure, the emphasis on pitch counts has ruined baseball-watching. Now, if you want to watch the Red Sox or Yankees, you need to invest four hours. If you want to watch a postseason game, you need to stay up until 1 a.m. and take the next day off work.</strong>

The obvious solution is not to watch the Yankees and Red Sox, which is remarkably easy for teams who aren't fans of those teams, or even of <em>rivals</em> of those teams. Souhan, where do you live?

Unfortunately, though, I agree with him about the playoffs. But it's not "pitch counts" that are the problem there. It's the fact that they start the games at 8 PM and have 10 minute commercial breaks. I think the horrible demon you have a problem with is not "walks," but rather "Fox."

<strong>But that's OK -- the emphasis on pitch counts is good for our society. It keeps people -- namely, baseball fans -- off the streets. Who has time to get into trouble when it takes 30 hours to watch a week's worth of Yankees games?</strong>

Yeah, and after watching something so boring, you have to sleep for the other 138 hours in the week. I mean, I get that you're trying to be sarcastic here. And given that you've been doing this since the birth of newspapers, you've probably had enough practice to realize that it should at least make <em>a little</em> sense.

<strong>So if you kids want to become big-leaguers, buy our DVD series and learn how to take pitches and drive up pitch counts.</strong>

This would be a valuable thing for kids to learn. By learning to take pitches that are outside the strike zone or aren't in the area you're focusing on, you make yourself a better baseball player. You can wait for a better pitch to hit so you can drive the ball and hit those long home runs. Or draw a walk so you can steal bases.

Good point, Souhan, driving up the pitch count is good for baseball, and leads to more exciting things happening. Wait, that's not what you were trying to say? You should probably try again on this one.

<strong>If you call now, we'll include a bonus DVD from Paul O'Neill on method acting -- specifically, how to act like every strike called against you is a moral outrage on the order of mass murder.</strong>

Wow, what's with the Paul O'Neill hate? And that was the last sentence of the article? Did your computer crash before you could finish? What happened here?

Okay, anyway Mr Souhan, if you've managed to stay awake through this whole thing, let me explain something to you so you don't make this mistake again. When people complain about the "pitch count" being a big problem in modern baseball, they're talking about the practice of lifting starting pitchers out of the game after 100 pitches. They are not talking about batters trying to draw walks to help their teams score more runs and win games. That's "OBP," and it's an entirely different "things were better back in the good old days, when men were men, women were women, and we walked uphill both ways to the stadium every day, in a snow storm" old timey rant.
