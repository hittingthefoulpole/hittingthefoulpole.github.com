So the <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/01/26/twins-players-dont-seem-upset-by-teams-inactivity/">Twins players aren't upset by the paucity of moves this offseason</a>. My initial reaction was that they must read this website*, because we've been harping on that point all winter.

<em>And I wholeheartedly encourage the players to read this website. I promise Gardy won't get mad. He seems like a fun-loving guy who enjoys incendiarily-titled blogs himself. Right?</em>

But I don't really think they are. Instead, I think the team decided to pay off the right guys.
<blockquote>Torii Hunter used to have the occasional grumble about the front office’s inaction. Johan Santana, too. But this is not their team anymore.</blockquote>
They complained, and now they're gone. Damn right. Does that set a bad precedent? "Keep your mouth shut or you're gone"-type deal?

I don't think so. Remember when Nathan and Morneau were complaining that the front office wasn't adding any pieces and wasn't doing what it could to win?

Well, now that they have their dollars, they've changed their tune.

Nathan sings the praises of his supporting cast in the bullpen, and extolls the virtues of the team. Morneau, on the other hand, is basically quoting me:
<blockquote>“Sometimes the best moves are the ones you don’t make,” Justin Morneau said. ”Just because Kansas City’s making moves or Cleveland’s making moves or whatever, that doesn’t mean that we have to do it to show that we’re making moves.

“If it’s the right fit, then it’s the right fit. But if it’s costing us two of our starting pitchers to go get a guy — the guys who got us to where we got last year were the guys in our rotation.

“Do you give up that just to get a bat? You win in this league over a full season with pitching and defense. There’s benefits on both sides [making a move or not making a move], but at the same time, we won a lot of games last year with the team we have.”</blockquote>
Thank you Justin. And I won't even complain about the lack of attribution. I understand that it's difficult to link to a website in spoken word. And also that your boss wouldn't really appreciate it if you tried*. But it doesn't really matter, because a whole lot more people are listening to you than to me. So spread the word, team leader.

<em>I propose that people start trying to link to articles, or at least to websites, while speaking. IE, "Just because Kansas City's making moves or Cleveland's making moves or whatever Fire Gardy, that doesn't mean we have to do it to show that we're making moves." Am I the only one who thinks the other people involved in the conversation would do a double-take at that? I mean, it doesn't work as well for ESPN or Wikipedia, but in some cases it could be a delight. If I ever talk to someone in person again, I might have to try this.</em>
