In the last couple of weeks, people have been looking intently at payroll efficiency, or how much a team spends per win. Unless you have unlimited funds (see: Yankees, Red Sox), it is virtually impossible to be consistently competitive unless you can sustainably keep the payroll from growing out of control as you climb the wins rankings.

One interesting way to measure a franchise's payroll efficiency is <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=8601">the concept of marginal dollars per marginal wins, from Baseball Prospectus</a>. Take it away, Steven Goldman:
<blockquote>In 2002, Baseball Prospectus's Doug Pappas proposed the concept of marginal dollars per marginal wins. Pappas suggested that a team playing entirely replacement-level players would win about 30 percent of its games, or 48.6 wins in a 162-game season. This team would be paid the major league minimum ($390,000 in 2008) and was assumed to have a 25-man roster, plus three players on the disabled list. In 2008, that team's payroll would have been $10,920,000. Every dollar a team spends over that minimum is more than it "has" to, but those marginal dollars do also earn the team marginal wins—victories they would not have earned had they only spent the minimum. The question is, how efficiently did the teams spend to get those extra wins?</blockquote>
So there is an absolute minimum a baseball team can pay for its team, around $11M. And statistically speaking, you'd have about a 48-49 win team for that amount. Any amount you spend above the minimum (ideally) increases your team's win total, and that's what we want to look at.

Goldman then looks at the marginal dollars per marginal wins ratios for all teams in 2008. The Twins came up with the third-lowest value in the league (where lower is more efficient), with a ratio of $1.1M per marginal win. They were behind the Marlins at $0.3M/MW, and the Rays at $0.68M/MW.

He immediately dismisses the Marlins' accomplishment: "(The <span class="teamdef">Marlins</span> were even more efficient than the Rays, posting a .522 winning percentage with a payroll of just under $22 million, but this was more a fluke event than an item for future study.)" And frankly, I don't have a problem with that. <em>No team</em> should ever model itself after the way the Marlins are run. They're a pox on the league, and are going to be as long as Jeffrey Loria owns them.

He's high on the Rays, apparently believing that they demonstrated "intelligent drafting and strong farm system production [...] augmented with intelligently spent free-agent dollars," and that their method is one to be admired. Although he does acknowledge that it remains to be seen if this method will continue to be successful and efficient as the years pass and their current crop of players shoot up the salary scale.

Goldman's analysis only touches on the Twins in comparing them to their similarly (but slightly less) efficient AL Central rival, the Indians.
<blockquote>Over the last three years, the AL Central rival Cleveland and Minnesota teams have averaged about $67 million in payroll each, while averaging 85 and 88 wins per team, respectively. This is even more impressive in the light of the bad contracts both teams have to live with. In Cleveland’s case, that would be the four-year, $57 million contract the team signed with designated hitter <span class="playerdef">Travis Hafner</span> in July of 2007, one which cost them $8.05 million last season and will ding them for $11.5 million this year. The Twins have made smaller-scale errors, anchoring themselves to replaceable talents like <span class="playerdef">Michael Cuddyer</span> and <span class="playerdef">Jason Kubel</span> through 2010 for a combined total of $22.1 million, not counting the price of 2011 options for both players. The Twins will also be paying $3.1 million to Milwaukee Brewer Mike Lamb this year.</blockquote>
I'm not going to get too snarky about this, nor am I going to defend the Cuddyer/Kubel contracts. I feel I've done that enough. I'm just going to go ahead and point out that in no way is this an examination of <em>how</em> the Twins and Indians have been able to build successful franchises on a small payroll. It is, in fact, <em>the opposite</em> in that he provides the only evidence that exists to show that the Twins and Indians are poorly run, without offering any insight into what they've done right. And clearly both teams have done something right.

Seriously, in what sense are the Twins and Indians <em>not</em> exactly the model by which every small- and mid-market team should build their organization? Why is it that whenever someone looks into payroll efficiency the numbers tell them "The Twins and Indians are really efficient at this," and their subsequent analysis says "The AL East is the greatest!"

Maybe I'll get to that at a later date. Moving along.

But to be honest, looking just at last year is misleading at best. Anything can happen in one season -- a team can have a big breakout season or luck can fall their way and they can look like a really efficiently-run franchise when in fact you may not want to model your organization after them based on a multi-year study. If only someone would look at payroll efficiency over a period of multiple years ...

Enter Rich Lederer, at Baseball Analysts, who looked into <a href="http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2009/03/20062008_payrol.php">MLB Payroll Efficiency, 2006-2008</a> for us. He looked at essentially the same data, but averaged it out over three seasons, which minimizes the effects a breakout (or collapse) has on the organization's overall efficiency rating. (See the 2008 Mariners vs the 2006-2008 Mariners. Seattle's 2008 was a truly terrible season, but it was probably an outlier. While they did run the franchise poorly enough to allow that to happen, 2008 is not almost certainly not indicative of a typical season for them.)

Let's take a look at his data:

<a href="http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2009/03/20062008_payrol.php"><img class="alignleft" title="Average Wins and Payroll" src="http://baseballanalysts.com/AVERAGE%20WINS%20AND%20PAYROLL%2C%202006-2008.png" alt="" width="380" height="519" /></a>As you can see from the chart, the Twins are sixth overall in wins over the last three years, and are the only team in the top 7 with an average payroll under $100M. In fact, the Twins' payroll is the lowest among the top 12 winningest teams in baseball.

By any measure, that's impressive. Another interesting finding that I did not expect to see is the overall quality of the AL Central; 4 of the top 11 winningest teams are from the Central. (Which four? If you guessed "Everyone but the Royals, duh," you're right on.) That's the most of any division, obviously. The AL East has 3 in the top 12, the NL East has 2, and the AL West, NL West, and NL Central have 1 each. This does <em>not</em> explain why the AL Central gets no national respect and is consistently considered one of the weaker divisions in the sport.

Looking at this chart, I think you can only call three teams consistently efficient: the Twins, Indians, and Blue Jays. These are the only teams in baseball that have averaged 85+ wins with average-or-under payrolls. In fact, these are the only teams in baseball that have averaged <em>83+</em> wins for <em>under $100M per year</em>.

Compared to the Twins' $1.1M/MW value for 2008, they have a $1.4M/MW efficiency ratio for the 2006-2008 period. (The reason the ratio improved in 2008 was because the payroll dropped to $56M and we actually improved. Just like I said we would at the beginning of the season, despite losing Santana and Hunter. Just wanted to point that out so all the pessimists know what's up.)

For the overall period, the Rays' M$/MW ratio is not 0.6, but is instead 1.1; while that value is still extremely impressive, what's less impressive is where they rank on the most-winningest list. 25th. Over the last three seasons, the Rays have won the 25th most games in the league.

Looking forward, the Rays are obviously in great position to win games and move up on the wins list. As that happens, though, they will obviously have to pay more as their players move up the salary scale and hit arbitration. It remains to be seen how willing they'll be to increase their payroll to sustainable levels, and how efficient they can stay as they inevitably have to pay more and/or replace players. I'm not here to take anything away from the Rays. But there is no doubt in my mind that, looking backwards, the Rays' method of building a winning team by stockpiling high draft picks (through a devious strategy of <em>being awful for a decade</em>) is <em>not</em> the way you should want to model your franchise.

Instead, the model franchises are the beasts of the AL Central, the Twins and Indians, who have shown an ability to be consistently successful with consistently low payrolls. The teams at the bottom of this chart should be looking to Minnesota and Cleveland for advice, rather than the Rays, Rockies, or any other team.

Sometime soon, I think I'll look into the successful models of the Twins and Indians. For now, though, it's enough to know that these franchises have earned considerably more respect than they get. Given that averaging just 83 wins per year costs other teams upwards of $100M, winning more than that for under $70M is extremely unusual and impressive.
