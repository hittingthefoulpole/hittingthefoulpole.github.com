I'm pretty sure this isn't a big deal, but Gomez will be <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/">sitting out </a>until Friday with a sore back.  With the way the schedule works, it makes sense for him not to play.  We have two road games this week, so he will be sticking around the Twins complex.  When you have a sore back, sitting on a bus for hours doesn't speed up the healing process.  I'm sure he will be fine in no time, but this is a good chance to get him some rest. 

Not really much other news today.  The Twins hit four bombs yesterday against the O's.  And won. 

Japan beat Korea in 10 innings last night in the finals of the WBC.  So we are done with this for a few years.

The West Michigan White Caps have introduced <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/29838746">this</a> as their newest concession item.  I almost threw up when I saw it.  Anything that has nearly 5,000 calories shouldn't be sold to the public.  I'd prefer it if they sold beer and cigarettes to children than this burger.  I mean come on, who in their right mind would eat this.  I don't even know HOW I would eat.  I guess with Minor League baseball you need to attract fans somehow, maybe if the fans spend part of a season eating these things they will eventually have to buy two seats.  Just like that, double your attendance.  Genius!

The Marlins got <a href="http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3109:marlins-finally-land-long-sought-after-stadium-funding&amp;catid=41:facility-news&amp;Itemid=56">funding</a>from Miami-Dade county for their new stadium. They got 515 million for the baseball only stadium, and 94 million for surrounding parking structures.  Say what you will about tax-payer funded stadiums, but if there is one team in the Majors who doesn't deserve one, its the Marlins.  Maybe the Nats too, but that ship has sailed.  I mean, most teams who have a tax-payer funded park have at least tried to put a winning team on the field.  Maybe not every year, but its hard to remain competitive year in and year out, it goes in cycles.  The O's seem to be on the rebound, the Mariners are in a rebuilding period, etc.  The only team that has no obligation to put a winning team on the field is the Giants.  Since they paid for their stadium themselves. They can do as they please, I guess.   The 94 million for parking will be repaid to the county as the team sells the spaces. Jeff Loria has to either sell the team, or get committed to having a good team by the time the stadium is up and running in 2012.  That means lock up Hanley Ramirez and your good young pitchers.  The team will also be changing their name to the Miami Marlins. I think that sounds dumb, but it was part of the agreement.
