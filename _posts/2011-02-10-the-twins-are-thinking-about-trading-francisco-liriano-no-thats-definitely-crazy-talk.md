Last week, the Twins signed Francisco Liriano to a one year, $4.3M deal to avoid arbitration this year. It was a wise move -- salary arbitration can be a rough process, with potential ramifications for the relationship between the team and the player, because in the course of making its case the team essentially has to do everything it can to insult the player. Additionally, the Twins have in the past signed a deal like this one to avoid arbitration while continuing to work on a long term extension; that's exactly what they did with Morneau, ripping up and replacing his one year contract with a six year extension after just one week.

So, a week later, what happens? Well, we get [a report from Joe Christensen](http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/115676604.html) that says that the Twins' relationship with their ace left hander is apparently already sour, and they do not plan to give him an extension -- in fact, he says that trading Liriano "isn't just crazy talk."

> One thing is clear: The Twins don't plan to sign him long term. Last weekend, they avoided arbitration with a one-year, $4.3 million deal. From what I've heard, their long-term talks went nowhere, with Liriano's camp hinting it wanted a three-year, $39 million contract.

First, let's take a look at Liriano's demands for a 3/$39M deal. He has two years of arbitration left, so that deal would cover one year of free agency. The second year of arbitration typically is valued at 60% of free market, and the third and final year is typically 80% of free market value. So this three year deal would effectively pay for 2.4 years of Liriano's free market services, which means Liriano's agent is placing a year of Liriano's services on the free agent market at $16.25; now, how good would Liriano have to be to be worth that price? I can't tell how much a win is going for on the free agent market right now, but it seems like it's somewhere between $4M/win and $5M/win. At $4M/win, that contract would value Liriano as a 4 WAR pitcher; at $4.5M/win, he'd have to be a 3.6 WAR pitcher; at $5M/win, he'd have to be a 3.25 WAR pitcher.

On the other hand, his $4.3M deal this year is supposed to be 60% of his free market value, which means his current contract values him at just $7.1M, probably taking into account his shaky track record and the fact that he remains a significant injury risk.

Let's take a gander at said shaky track record -- in 2006 he put up 4.1 WAR in a shortened season prior to his injury, and that injury and his slow recovery from it led to 0 WAR in a missed 2007, 1.5 WAR in 2008, and 1.1 WAR in 2009, before he broke out again and posted 6.0 WAR as one of the top pitchers in the league in 2010. And all his predictive statistics indicate that his performance was sustainable and will even improve with better-than-the-worst-luck-in-the-league. If you believe he's healthy and can remain healthy, Liriano seems like a safe bet to be a 4 WAR pitcher and the contract is a no-brainer. If you think he's a huge injury risk or that his success in 2006 and 2010 was a fluke and his true talent lies somewhere in the "can't throw strikes or get anybody out" range that he showed in 2008 and 2009 while his velocity was down, then you probably wouldn't want to guarantee him any more money or years than you absolutely have to.

The Star Tribune is -- at the very least -- strongly implying that this is the Twins' thinking. That the Twins front office is actually down on Liriano and does not want to sign him to an extension. That they are, like some sportswriters and fans, selectively seeing only Liriano's failures in 2010 and not his dominant outings. That they're seriously entertaining the idea of trading Liriano for pennies on the dollar.

> in his final 20 starts, including the postseason, he didn't finish the eighth inning once.

That seems like an odd measure of talent. The ability to finish eight innings in a start? In the second half of your first full major league season in your career, after pitching all winter in winter ball and all summer at multiple levels the previous year while recovering from major elbow surgery? I hope that's not a "stat" that people lend any real credence to.

> In his much-hyped showdown with Colorado's Ubaldo Jimenez, the Rockies batted around in the first inning. The Twins won all five of Liriano's starts against the White Sox, but his performances were more white-knuckle than dominant.

He had a bad game, and then he won a bunch of games against a division rival during a pennant race, but those don't count because they were close games.

> Then, in Game 1 of the Division Series, Liriano had a 3-0 lead in the sixth inning when the Yankees came back to tie it. Afterward, Liriano was his usual polite self, but it was a huge letdown for the team.

Then he lost a game in the playoffs, and it counts because it was a close game.

Oh, and if you think that "logic" from the Star Tribune (or, worse, the Twins) is inane, here's some more. This time from [Howard Sinker, "analyzing" how the Twins could make a trade work](http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/115715034.html).

> The fact that manager Ron Gardenhire has talked about the need for more speed in the middle infield is all well and good. But when you have the chance to replace Alexi Casilla with Michael Young, this is a time when you sacrifice speed and some defense and go for the bat. Casilla would make a fine fifth infielder.

> And as Jim Bowden, the former Reds and Nationals GM, said on his XM/Sirius show Wednesday afternoon, the Rangers are in a position where they won't get 100 percent value for Young.

> In a deal with the Twins, that would mean Texas picking up a big chunk of Young's salary. For the Rangers, it means getting a lefty pitcher who doesn't have Lee's credentials, but brings a lot more to them than other options. (Somehow, I don't think that signing ex-Brewer Dave Bush is viewed as a replacement for Lee.)

> Rangers beat writer Evan Grant wrote the other day that "right now, about all you can get (for Young) is a bad contract." The Rockies had been talking about a Young deal that included second baseman Eric Young Jr.

> So Liriano totally blows away anything that's been discussed -- which is why the Rangers have so far dismissed what's on the table.

So, let me get this straight. The Twins suddenly have an "opportunity" to replace their speed-oriented middle infield with a "bat" in the form of Michael Young. And the Rangers are in the position of having to either eat Young's ridiculous salary or take a pittance in a trade, or both. That's why the trade market for Young's services are ice cold -- other teams realize he's an old man whose contract matches his production so poorly that he's not worth acquiring even if the Rangers pick up most of his salary. And since the Rangers won't get full value, and the best offer they've received so far is Eric Young Jr -- who has never been better than replacement level in his career, with a -0.3 WAR and -0.4 WAR in the last two seasons -- the obvious solution is that the Twins should offer _Francisco Liriano_, their best pitcher, one of their best players?

Sinker is right that Liriano totally blows away anything that's been discussed in the Young talks thus far. And that's because if the Twins are offering Liriano to the Rangers, the return should be more like Neftali Feliz + high end prospects, rather than drastically-overpaid-old-guy. [Dave Cameron expects that Liriano's trade value is somewhere between Marcum's and Garza's](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/whats-francisco-liriano-worth/),* and thus should yield someone close to a top prospect but not an absolute-top-shelf prospect. Note in that article that Michael Young isn't mentioned, because it's ludicrous to even consider that.

_* That's the Garza 2 trade, when the Rays got all of the Cubs' top prospects for him. Not the Garza 1 trade when the Twins got a busted prospect for him. Bill Smith just keeps looking better and better, eh?_

Oh ... and if it's a good idea to scrap the speed-in-the-middle-infield plan in favor of an infielder who can actually hit, what about the one the Twins gave up, JJ Hardy? He offered elite defense at shortstop -- something Young absolutely does not. He offered a bat with some pop in it -- something Young absolutely does not. He had an affordable contract -- something Young absolutely does not. He yielded a couple of mediocre relief pitchers in a trade -- not anything close to the value of Liriano.

I can't tell what the Star Tribune is doing here. Have they actually heard, from the Twins, that Liriano-for-Young talks have happened, or that the Twins are considering starting such talks? Are they accurately representing the Twins' views on Liriano? Or are they making this up, speculating for the sake of stirring the hot stove pot, baiting clicks to their website where they automatically refresh the page every 30 seconds to goose their pageviews and falsely inflate their pageview statistics to get a better rate on their advertisements? Have they really become this desperate, now that Phil Mackey and ESPN have rendered them completely useless? Ouch.

> Publicly, the Twins keep saying Liriano is a big part of their 2011 plans. They'd love to see him prove the skeptics wrong and blossom into a 20-game winner, even if this leaves fans screaming about their decision not to sign him long term.

When your best hope is that you get embarrassed -- and you work to ensure that'll happen no matter what -- then you're doing something wrong.

What do you think? Are the Twins seriously considering this, or is the Strib just stirring the pot? What do you think is the right thing to do with Liriano -- go year to year through arbitration, sign him to a long term extension, or trade him? And what do you think is a reasonable return in trade, or size of contract?
