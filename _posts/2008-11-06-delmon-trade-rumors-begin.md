Just saw a note at BP that <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=8283">the Twins are interested in Kevin Kouzmanoff</a>, and are willing to trade Delmon Young to get him.

I have to say, I don't get it. Kouzmanoff will be 27, and he's just another low-OBP guy whose power will certainly evaporate once he comes near the Twins' clubhouse. Why would we give up a promising young player to get him?

His home-road splits are at least encouraging; when he gets out of the spacious confines of Petco Park, he's a .282/.330/.488 hitter, versus .243/.290/.390 at home. So he's actually the opposite of Garrett Atkins, who will certainly be considerably less valuable if he doesn't play at Coors Field.

This comes down to the fact that the Twins think they have four starters in the outfield, and they only want three of them. But the 2008 season demonstrated how valuable it is to have depth; one of the outfielders went down and we didn't miss a beat because we had another to step right in. If we lose one of these guys, we'll be seeing a lot of Pridie next season, and I don't know about you but I'd much rather keep him stashed at AAA until Revere/Morales/Parmelee/Benson/Hicks have advanced through the system and we can safely dump him into the Mississippi or something.

Frankly, I hope this is an unfounded rumor. I'm not a proponent of trading Delmon away, and if we do I'd hope we'd get something a little better than Kevin Kouzmanoff.
