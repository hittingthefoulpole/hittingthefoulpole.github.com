As many of you may know, we have lots of infielders in camp, none of whom (aside from Morneau) really stand out.  They way I see our starting infield should be as follows: 1B Morneau, 2B Harris, 3B Lamb, SS Everett.  We should keep Punto on the bench and depending on how they perform in the spring one of Buscher or Watkins.  I think Casilla should move to his natural position of SS and play everyday there in AAA.  He is clearly very raw and would not benefit at all from riding the bench and getting ragged on by Gardy.  So assuming we carry 12 pitchers, which we usually do, our roster looks like this: C: Mauer, Redmond; 1B: Morneau, 2b: Harris, Punto; 3B: Lamb, Buscher/Watkins; SS; Everett; OF:Kubel, Young, Cuddyer, Monroe, Pridie (or one of the other guys, too close to call).  Obviously we can see Punto's value since he can play 3 positions.  Whereas Buscher can backup 3B or 1B.  Watkins can back up third, is trying to be emergency catcher which immensely adds to his value, and I'm sure in a pinch he can play some second.  For a guy who has been in the minors for a decade, I'm sure he won't let a little position unfamiliarity stop him from playing in the majors.
