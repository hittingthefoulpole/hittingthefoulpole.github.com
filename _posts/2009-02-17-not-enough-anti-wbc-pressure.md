This morning we learned that <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/02/17/morning-briefing/">Liriano is considering skipping the WBC</a> in favor of spending as much time as he can with the Twins and getting ready for the season.

Overall, I think this is great news. However, that news is followed by this disastrous line:
<blockquote>Liriano said no one has put pressure on him to pull out of the tournament, but heâ€™s definitely thinking about it. He said he will speak with the Twins to get their thoughts.</blockquote>
Are you <em>kidding</em> me? Why in blazes has there been no pressure put on him? Are people too afraid to be accused of being anti-patriotism or something?

Seriously. Players are leaving their teams, who pay them millions of dollars, and enter into a situation in which they can easily get injured. Just for the sake of some flag waving. And for the Cubans to trot out a crappy old lineup based not on talent but on loyalty to the government. And for Japan to rub our faces in their crappy league rules with plenty of major league talent that should be making real money here in America.

Forget this. When Liriano talks to the Twins, they'd better put some pressure on him -- subtle if possible, less so if necessary -- to stay the hell away from the WBC and within sight of Rick Anderson for the entire spring.
