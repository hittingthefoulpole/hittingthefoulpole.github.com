Over the past few weeks FanGraphs has been ranking every organization based on front office, ownership, major league talent, and minor league talent.  The Twins ranked <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/organizational-rankings-18/">18th</a>overall.  We received a C- in ownership, a B- in front office,  a B- in major league talent, and a C+ in minor league talent.  I personally think that each of thses grades is a notch too low.

The ownership, while very, very cheap, hasn't gotten in the way.  Many teams have spent roughly the same amount as the Twins over the years, but haven't performed as well due to an overbearing owner. 

The front office probably deserves the grade it got.  Maybe it should have a B instead of a B-.  We draft and scout better than almost anyone in the game, but our free agent signings have left a lot to be desired. 

The one that irks me the most is the major league talent.  A B-?  We have an all-star closer, and all-star catcher, an all-star starting pitcher,  and an all-star/MVP first baseman.  How is that roughly average?  Calling Morneau a "minor" star is borderline insulting.  Just because he plays in Minnesota and is from Canada doesn't make him a minor star.  He is a HR derby champ, an MVP and an all-star.  We have one of the best young pitching staffs in the game, does "major league talent" equal "star power" thats the way it seems.  He failed to even mention Kevin Slowey or Scott Baker, who were both very good starters last year on a team that nearly made the playoffs.  I would chalk this up to east-coast bias, but Dave Cameron is from Seattle.  Maybe he is bitter we stuck him with Carlos Silva or something. 

The only teams ranked behind us are: Nationals, Marlins, Astros, Royals, Pirates, Padres, Reds, Rockies, Tigers, Cardinals, Blue Jays and Giants.  I think we have a better organization than the White Sox.  While they have better international scouting, and they spend more money I would hardly say they are top to bottom a better run organization.  Hopefully they come in at around 17 or so.  Because they really aren't that much better than the Twins.  The Mariners should be ranked pretty low too.  Until the hiring of a new front office staff a few months ago, they were a total mess.  They have done some good things this offseason, but even though this is a forward looking exercise, they will be haunted by the recent bad decisions that have been made.  More specifically Carlos Silva and jarrod washburn. 

I also don't think these rankings give enough credit for not making moves.  How many times have we cheered for Bill Smith when he passed on a certain player.  Eric Gange or someone of the like. 

Cameron also doesn't give enough credit to our minor league system.  While it isn't stocked with studs like other teams.  We have many solid players who are close to contributing to the majors. 

Going back to the ownership grade.  Now that carl is gone, Jim seems very willing to extend our young homegrown players, whom we had previously refused to pay.  Jim was behind the Morneau and Cuddyer contracts, Scott Baker was just signed a few weeks ago.  If this truly is a "forward thinking exercise" why does it seem like our low ownership grade is based on the reign of a man who has been dead for several months?  Jim has shown his willingness to spend on player who can contribute for the life of their contract.  If "good ownership" means giving a huge contract to a player who will be bad for more than half of it, then I don't want good ownership.

What do you guys think of the Twins grades and overall ranking?
