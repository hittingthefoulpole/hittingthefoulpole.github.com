Well, I haven't posted anything since the Twins season ended, and a lot has with the Twins since then.  Sirsean has covered most of it, but I'll give you my analysis.
<ul>
	<li>Earlier this week the Twins traded defensive specialist Carlos Gomez to the Brewers for power-hitting shortstop JJ Hardy.  When you say it like that, it sounds as though the Twins got a steal of a deal.  Hardy is coming off a career worst season, and spent time in the minors last year.  This benefits the Twins because he remains under team control for one additional year.  I've always been a big JJ Hardy fan and hoped the Twins would make this move at some point.  I assumed we would have to give up pitching, which you always hate to do.  However, the Twins have a ton of back of the rotation type starters so I wouldn't have had a problem with them shipping someone like Perkins to the Brewers. So when I heard that we gave up just Gomez I was thrilled.  Gomez is an elite defensive centerfielder, and with our flyball pitching staff he was quite the asset.  Hardy has shown he can be a good hitter at the major league level, so hopefully his 2009 season was just a fluke.</li>
	<li>I'm cool with exercising Cuddyer's option.  Nyer can suck it.</li>
	<li>There are still a few items left of the offseason checklist. I think we need to address one of second or third base.  Possibly re-sign Pavano or someone similar. I don't want to trade Joe Nathan, so we won't be doing that.</li>
	<li>I hope to get an offseason goals post up sometime this week.</li>
</ul>
