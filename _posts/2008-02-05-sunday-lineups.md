One trend that I would love to see Gardy stop doing is by using Sundays as a rest day for the majority of the starters. It seems like the general lineup the Twins throw out there on Sundays makes it damn near impossible to win.  It bugged me even more when he would do this with Santana pitching.  I understand that players need rest, (except for Bronko Nagurski, he never got off days or bye weeks) and it is difficult to play a day game after a night game, but I would rather see players off days be spread out a little more, rather than put an entire roster full of Puntos and Tyners on to the field.
