Before this series, I said the Twins needed to win 2 out of 3 against the Yankees.  They did not. The could have, if it weren't for some curious pitching moves on Friday evening. Let's not dwell on that though.  I think we <em>can</em> consider this weekend a success. Why? Well, I'm sure you have read thousands of words on the subject in the last 24 hours, so I won't waste many more.  The Twins won a game in Yankees stadium (new or old) in what seems like decades. They had success against the core of the vaunted Yankee bullpen. And finally they won the game with a hit in a bases loaded situation.  Thats like at least 3 monkeys off of their backs.

Splitting the season series with the Yankees is acceptable. Losing 2 of 3 to a very good team in their stadium isn't the end of the world.  Now we need the Yankees to return the favor when they come to Minneapolis next week.

So everyone take a deep breath, and say it with me: We beat the Yankees in the Bronx.

Now if only Gardy didn't use Guerrier.....
