Looks like the Twins picked up livan hernandez.  He can earn close to 7 million with incentives.  Not sure how I feel about this move.  Sure, he can eat innings, and he isn't that old.  However, he has a ton of miles on him so who knows.  This could be another Ponson move, but I think everyone can agree the Livan is much better than Ponson or Ortiz, Ramon.  Although he has never pitched in the AL, this move is basically like having Silva for less money.  He give up more homers than Silva, but he provides some stability to the young rotation.
