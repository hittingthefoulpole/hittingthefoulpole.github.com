I was at the game last night. I stood, huddled out of the rain for two hours while a torrential downpour punished US Cellular Field (presumably for those dorky pinwheels). Finally, they started the game at 9 o'clock, despite the fact that it was still drizzling. I was not bullish on the team's chances in the game. For one thing, they'd looked awful the night before. Secondly, Buerhle was pitching, and he always kills the Twins. And Monroe was in the 3-hole and Redmond-Tolbert-Punto were in a row. And the field was soaked. I said to my brother: "What are the odds the Twins score a run tonight?"

Well Carlos Gomez greeted me by crushing the third pitch of the game, lining it hard over the fence in left. When he makes contact on those "Who cares if I'm swinging way too hard?" swings, the ball can really sail. The Twins had scored a run, and beaten the odds.

Thankfully, the offense exploded for 13 runs on 16 hits, while Livan Hernandez took a shutout into the 9th (and promptly lost it when Jermaine "Roid Rage" Dye put one over the fence). And Carlos Gomez hit for the cycle ... entertainingly, in reverse order -- homer, triple, double, single. This is one of those dizzying highs for Gomez's season, and I'm certainly enjoying it.

In the 5th inning, the Twins were putting a good threat together. Men on first and second, nobody out. Punto steps up to the plate. At the time, it was a 1-0 game, and it seemed this would be our chance to break the game open against Buerhle. Punto bunted, and <em>proceeded not to run to first</em>. Redmond was thrown out at third (it kind of negates the point of a sacrifice bunt if the guy on base is too slow to advance to the next base). It was a tough slide, and almost knocked Crede down ... but he still had time to notice that Punto was still standing at home plate and set himself to throw Punto out. Quickly, the promising inning was no more thanks to a certain Nick Punto. (Gomez promptly tripled home a run, and Punto finished his game by hitting a couple of doubles and driving in 5 runs, so I guess someone really lit into him in the dugout. My guess is it wasn't Gardy.)

(Quick aside: Over the offseason, Punto apparently worked out with Manny Ramirez. I wondered, at the time, what that would result in. Would Punto gain some strength at be able to hit a home run? Would Manny start playing with reckless abandon while trying to justify his contract? Neither seemed that believable. But last night, we finally discovered what Punto learned while hanging out with Manny: "Manny being Manny." He put down that bunt and just stood there in the batter's box, admiring his splendid work, just like Manny does when he pounds a homer (or near-homer). The thing is, "Punto being Punto" doesn't have the same ring to it.)

This game really was incredible. It's what you'd expect the first place team to be able to do once in a while. And excellence (13 runs, Gomez's cycle, Livan's gem) managed to completely overshadow utter incompetence (Punto's "bunt").

Slowey starts against Danks this afternoon, and we'll get to see if the Twins can build off this performance.
