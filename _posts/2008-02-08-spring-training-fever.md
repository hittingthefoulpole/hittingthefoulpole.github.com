As we near the reporting of pitchers and catchers to spring training, I start to get very excited about my near annual hajj to Ft. Myers.  For those Twins fans (or baseball fans in general) who have not been to Ft. Myers, you are missing out on a trip of a lifetime.  Whether you are taking a family trip, or going with your drunken, idiot friends (like me) there is something in store for all.  The Lee County Sports Complex is widely regarded as the best Spring Training facility in Major League Baseball.  I do not know if it is the best or not, but I can tell you first hand that it is leaps and bounds better than the Red Sox training facility, also located in Ft. Myers.  The Twins facility offers up close views of players taking infield, hitting in the batting cages, and pitching in the batting cages, all without purchasing a ticket.  Also, on off days, you can get a free look at an intrasquad scrimmage or practice.  If you are an autograph seeker, there are many easy opportunities to get signatures.  At the Red Sox facility, all you can do without a ticket is park far away, and buy overpriced Red Sox merchandise. 

There are also plenty of great beaches and restaurants in the area, including great seafood.  Ft. Myers Beach provides many miles of white sandy beaches, complete with areas for young people to party (lots of bars), as well as areas for adults and families to relax and play.  Sanibel Island is also is a great place to visit, and also contains one of my favorite restaurants of all time, The Timbers Restaurant.  I suggest the cruchy grouper. (Just to keep in mind, I love good food at a cheap price and cold beer) All in all, every Twins fan needs to make this trip at least once.  Even if the game you see has a starting third baseman whose number is 92, he is not listed in the program, and he is still better than Punto; it is great to sit in the warm sun and watch outdoor baseball during February or March.  You will find many great Minnesotans down there, and they are very easy to spot due to their extreme paleness.  Plan this trip and you will definitely go back.
