Since arriving in 2004, even more than his on-the-field production, Nick Punto's main contribution to the team and its fans has been that he has represented the Minnesota Twins to the world.

When I say _represented_, I mean it in a good way, I think. Nick Punto has embodied the Twins' Platonic ideal of what a position player should be; high-effort, high-hustle, defensive-minded, versatile, singles hitter who values a high batting average at the expense of walks and extra base hits. Nick Punto has also been a metaphor for the team's success over the past several years; outmatched on paper by superior teams with higher payrolls, with virtues that seem to exist but can't (yet?) be quantified, but somehow competitive year in and year out.

I've given Punto more than his fair share of grief over the years. My thinking had been along the lines of what a utility player like Punto is worth to a team -- for a good team with a high payroll and many good players and the expectation of contending, a good utility guy is worth a lot more than he would be to a team with a low payroll and a smaller collection of good players. If Punto is the fifth-most important player on your team, then you have a bad team; if Punto is the tenth-most important player, then you have a good team.

And I always thought that the Twins could have spent Punto's salary better in other places, when they had smaller payrolls and dollars were scarce. Now that the team has more revenue and a higher payroll, I naturally assumed that bringing back Punto was essentially a no-brainer. Not only could the team clearly afford it, but he has fans among his teammates and the coaching staff and the media and the fanbase. [Joe Christensen points out that that assumption appears to be faulty](http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/114332359.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUo8cyaiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr):

> Punto is still a free agent, but from all indications, the Twins won't be bringing him back.

What?

There are a few options, as I see it, to explain what the Twins may be thinking.

- Nick Punto is over the hill, and/or his performance will drop below what they have come to expect from him
- The performance gap between Punto and Tolbert will be smaller than the salary gap, and they're making a value play
- They simply can't afford it
- They disagree with my premise that a utility player is more valuable to a high-payroll team and don't think they need him any more
- They are signalling that they are adjusting their vision of the ideal ballplayer -- throwing out the mold, if you will

The Twins would have you believe that the issue is money, and they cannot afford Punto's services:

> With a projected Opening Day payroll of $113 million, they insist they have reached their limit. Insiders say Carl Pavano's contract actually pushed them over budget, requiring special approval from CEO Jim Pohlad.

On the other hand, Christensen asserts that "even if it meant taking a sizeable pay cut, Punto would be thrilled to return," though he doesn't provide a source. Maybe Punto told him as much directly, and maybe he didn't. The sizeable paycut angle, I think, bashes a crowbar against the kneecaps of both the performance/salary gap theory and the overall can't-afford-it theory, regardless of what ownership claims about how broke they are.* If they wanted Punto and could get him at a significant paycut from $4M, they'd do it.

_* Am I falling into the trap of thinking that now that Target Field is open, the Twins have virtually unlimited funds? I haven't seen their revenue numbers, but they've stated that team payroll will remain pegged to 52% of revenue as it was when they played in the Metrodome. Maybe it really is true that $110M or so is the payroll limit, and they've gone above it. I don't think I believe that, but it's certainly possible._

That leaves the theories that involve the Twins no longer wanting Punto around.

So, which is it? Is Punto over the hill, and the Twins don't think he's good any more? Do they not think they need a solid utility man, and can get by with a lesser one? Or have they changed their idea of the quintessential Twin, and are moving in a different direction?

I don't think it's possible to know that. Bill Smith certainly isn't going to come out and explain it for us.

Regardless of the reasons, though, if Nick Punto doesn't return to the Twins it sure feels like the end of an era.
