So now we have nothing to do sports-wise until pitchers and catcher report in two weeks.  And even then, watching Boof Bonser run wind sprints on the local news every night is not something I look forward to.  We have analyzed and debated pretty much everything there is to argue about the Twins.  Possible trade, possible signing, potential lineups, potential bench players, the list goes on.  As someone who seems to have an opinion/conspiracy theory about everything, I can honestly say I have run out of topics on the Twins.  For now.  We've been at this for about a year now.  We might be the only people who thought it would be a good idea to start a baseball blog in January, but I want to thank everyone who has been reading us on a regular basis.  Thats right, all three of you. 

The new Twins ad aired during the game last night, I thought it was OK.  Not sure why Target field would be receiving a delivery of lumber.  Are they planning on making lots of things out of wood?  Also, why are our highly paid athletes driving trucks? While wearing uniforms?  Is Pohlad (I know he is "dead", but I think its all a scam for tax purposes) that cheap that he is putting them to work in the off season as truck drivers?  Isn't that a union thing, I hope the teamsters don't sabotage the construction site.  As you can see, by that previous line of questions I have begun to go crazy due to lack of baseball, or exciting baseball related news. 

That is all.
