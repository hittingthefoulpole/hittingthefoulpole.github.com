Now that we enter the worst month in the wide world of sports, we really have to dig for things to discuss.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) Gardy and Nick Punto supply us with enough fodder to last a lifetime. 

One of the biggest questions going into the season is what crazy scheme will Gardy come up with in order to weasel Punto into the lineup on a regular basis.  Here is how i see it, he will rotate him through 4 positions: second, third, short, and DH. Since Gardy has no idea what a DH is supposed to do, I will give him a hint. They hit.  He no longer has jason tyner to use in the DH spot, so he sees Punto as his next best option.  Kubel should get the bulk of the DH ABs, with Rondell White 2 backing him up. That is all.
