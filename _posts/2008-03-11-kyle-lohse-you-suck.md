Who does Kyle Lohse think he is?  While Scott Boras may be crying collusion, I just think GMs realize signing Lohse to a long term contract isn't a wise investment. He is inconsistent on the mound, and unstable in the head. Why pay him lots of money for a long time.  Boras is willing to allow Lohse to sit out April, and even May in the hopes teams will get desperate for a healthy starting pitcher and a bidding war will start. I don't see this happening.  Teams have shown a willingness to hand the ball over to young pitchers from their own system, and try to win with them.  I think Lohse needs to swallow his pride, and accept whatever minor league or 1 year deal he is offered.  He can't really afford to miss all of spring training, and part of the season.  Roger Clemens could because he was really good (steroids asides, he was a damn fine pitcher). Kyle Lohse is not the Rocket and can't come in mid season and dominate opposing lineups.  He is a back of the rotation starter, and he needs to realize he isn't an ace.  His career could take a turn for the worse, if like Keyshawn Johnson who didn't realize he was actually a possession receiver, he doesn't wake up.
