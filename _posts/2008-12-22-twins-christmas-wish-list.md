While it has become very clear that I have a different set of wishes (and possibly goals) for the Twins than they do for themselves, I am going to lay out a list anyway.  While there really isn't much I reasonably believe the Twins will go after, I also plan on throwing in a few things I wish for them NOT to do. 
<ul>
	<li>Acquire one or two right-handed bullpen arms.  If the price becomes too high, stick with what you have.  Don't sign a third or fourth tier free agent just because.  Give more innings to Breslow and Mijares, not scrap heap players who were slightly below league average in 2000.</li>
	<li>Do not trade Kevin Slowey.  I am pretty sure this has already come true, as it seems that Smith has turned down several trading partners who asked for Slowey.  However, I would still like to stress it.</li>
	<li>Use Punto off the Bench in a utility role.  This is where is is most (or the only way in which he is) valuable. </li>
	<li>Platoon Buscher/Harris correctly.  If Buscher goes 4-4 with 2 homers or something against a righty, and a lefty is pitching the next day, do not start him because he is "hot".  Do it right. Buscher against righties, harris against lefties.  No questions about it.</li>
	<li>Do not trade Delmon.  His value is WAY down from a year ago.  If we trade him now, there is no way we get anything close to  Garza/Bartlett.  I work in the financial industry, and buying high and selling low is not what you are supposed to do.  Unless you hate money/winning. </li>
</ul>
That is about it.  What else should the Twins do/not do?  If Punto stays in a utility role like he should, who plays short?  How many of my "wishes" will come true?  My guess is none.
