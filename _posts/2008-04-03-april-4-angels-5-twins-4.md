I was only able to see the first 5 innings of this game, which turned out to be the bad ones.  Slowey looked OK until he left the game with, what Joe C is reporting, a bicep strain.  Bass didn't look very good, I really am not a fan of that guy, mainly because he really didn't deserve to make the team.  The bats were pretty dead through the first 5, but according to the internet the woke up as I was walking from the dome back to my office.  Mauer had a good day at the plate with 2 doubles. Morneau finally got his first RBI, and Gomez was again impressive with 2 hits, although no steals. That is understandable considering Ervin was hitting 96 on the gun with ease.  Good to see Kubel hit a homer, hopefully that will earn him more ABs. I think Gardy will give more ABs to monroe (we are no longer treating his name as a proper noun) in order to "give Craig-y a chance to catch up". It makes no sense, but that is the kind of logic Gardy will use. Not cool.  Gomez had a bunt single, I didn't see it so I'm not sure if it was good or just lucky.  He also hit the cutoff man the one time I saw him relay a ball into the infield.  Torii got his first homer of the season, I would have liked him to have been 0 for the series, but oh well.We open up a weekend series against KC tomorrow night, they are coming off of a big sweep of the Tigers, so we can't be taking anything for granted. I think we are sending Baker, Livan, and Boof out.
