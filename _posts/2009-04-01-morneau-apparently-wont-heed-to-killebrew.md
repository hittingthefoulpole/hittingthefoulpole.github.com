Over the course of spring training, we've been hearing more and more about the Twins attempting to unlock Delmon Young's power potential, by simply telling him to "pull the ball more." He's clearly been trying to do that, and he's combined a few home runs with a bunch of weak grounders to the left side of the infield. While it demonstrates that he's willing to listen to the team, I felt that it also demonstrates the team's inability to teach power hitting.

We've also heard about Justin Morneau talking to Harmon Killebrew about home run hitting. It appeared to work, because Morneau immediately started putting balls over the fence. My first thought was "why doesn't Killebrew also talk to Delmon?" That's when I found out<a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/42166252.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUqCP:iUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr"> exactly what Killebrew told Morneau</a>.
<blockquote>"When I was a young player, I hit for a high average and hit the ball all over the ballpark," Killebrew said. "One year in spring training, I think I was 18 or a little older, [Hall of Famer Ralph] Kiner came up to me and said, 'Kid, you're never going to hit a lot of home runs consistently if you don't pull the ball. That doesn't mean you pull every pitch, but to hit home runs consistently, that's what you have to do.' "</blockquote>
So that's what he told Morneau. "Pull the ball more." While it <em>appears</em> to have made a difference, it seems to me that this is a lot like Ted Williams being a hitting coach; "Come on, just hit the ball. It's not that hard."

But then we learn something a little disheartening. Morneau is in fact NOT listening to Killebrew.
<blockquote>"If he told me to stand with my back facing the pitcher, I'd try it because he's got 573 homers," Morneau said. "He obviously knew what he was doing. So I definitely tried it. I just feel comfortable with what I'm doing."</blockquote>
He tried it. It worked. Then he decided to go back to his old ways because he was more comfortable that way. You know what'd make me more comfortable? A cleanup hitter named Justin Morneau who hits 40 homers and is the second coming of Harmon Killebrew.

<a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/shysterball/article/killer-advice/">Craig Calcaterra has this to say</a>:
<blockquote>Morneau is basically ignoring Killebrew on this point, even if he is doing so in the most polite way possible. Which is a shame, really, because though I don't know that I've seen enough of Morneau to say if he could actually become a Killeresque hitter one day, he'd be a far more interesting player if he tried.Â </blockquote>
I've seen a whole lot more of Morneau than Calcaterra has, and I still don't know if he can (or can't) be a Killebrew-esque power hitter. But I sure can't argue that it'd be fun to watch him try.

Also, if "pull the ball more" is all the advice you need to hit with more power, why is it that "hitting to all fields" is valued as a veteran, smart thing to do?

And is it at least possible that Morneau take one or two big pull-happy hacks per plate appearance and then goes back to his comfortable "shoot it to left" approach?
