Maybe Bill Smith hasn't been sitting on his hands all offseason.  Maybe he has just been waiting for prices on everything to drop.  For a lot of free agents this offseason, its been a staring contest between teams and players, waiting to see who blinks first.  Outside of the Yankees, most teams have been good about not caving to initial demands.  Scott Boras looks like an idiot now after telling all of his clients to decline arbitration.  Some say the Union suggested big name players do this as well.  The players who are in the most trouble are the ones who cost a draft pick.  Juan Cruz is a name that stands out to me.  He was pretty good last year, but doesn't have that much of a track record.  So why should a team pay him a ton of money, and give up draft picks?  He could end up on a bad team whose picks are protected, but those are the teams who won't give him a big contract.  A catch-22 really.  I could totally be misusing that phrase, but who cares.  I do what I want.

I believe the players will blink first.  They are the ones who are unemployed.  Could the price of Ty Wigginton (for example) drop so low that he falls into the price range of the Twins.  Say what you want about Wigginton, but the price was the thing keeping me away, not his skillset.  If we can get him for two years, why not.  I have a feeling some players might sign a one year deal, hope they have a kickass year, and then next year go for the mega-bucks.  Who knows, the economy might have rebounded by then, and teams will have more money to throw around.  That would be in the best interest of the Twins, because we could nab a few normally high priced vets at bargain prices for the short term. They in turn are playing for their next payday so they but up good numbers for us, and we all part of good terms at seasons end.  It's a win-win.  Thoughts?  Did Bill Smith do the right thing by waiting for prices to drop, or was he foolish to make no moves early in the offseason?  Did most of the agents overestimate their clients ability to get a big contract?
