Matt Capps joined the Twins on July 30, and pitched an inning for the save -- early on he had some struggles, blowing two of his first three save opportunities and allowing plenty of baserunners. But he's been solid, if unspectacular, assuming you're the sort of person who wouldn't make fun of him because his middle name is "Dicus."

With the Twins, Capps has a 2.08 ERA in 26 IP, with 16 saves in 18 chances. He's struck out 21, walked 8, and is holding batters to a .255/.314/.330 line which isn't bad.

Meanwhile Jesse Crain has emerged as a legitimate relief ace; during the same time period (since July 30), Crain has pitched 24.1 IP in 27 games, with a 1.48 ERA, 24 K, 13 BB,* and is holding batters to a phenomenal .175/.290/.213 hitting line. Seriously, opponents are _slugging .213_ against him.

_* This is higher than I thought it would be, and I'm guessing it comes from two things. One, he recently had a stretch of 7 straight games in which he walked a guy. Two, he's been relying extremely heavily on his slider, and if the hitter lays off it there's a chance it misses the strike zone and gets a walk. The thing is, it's tough not to swing at that pitch._

Capps and Crain use their arsenals completely differently -- Capps is all fastballs all the time, while Crain has focused much more heavily on his breaking balls this year.

Capps throws his 94 MPH fastball 81.5% of the time, his slider 14.7% of the time, and his change is only thrown 3.8% of the time. Capps uses his fastball this way for good reason; his fastball is +2.07 runs per hundred pitches, while his slider is -1.04 and his change-up is listed at a "you should never throw this" -8.48 (seriously, the only way it can get that bad is if batters clobber it every time you throw it).

Meanwhile, Crain only throws his 94 MPH fastball 42.3% of the time, his slider comes in 46.2% of the time, his curveball 10%, and he throws his change just 1.4% of the time. Crain's fastball doesn't seem to be of the same quality as Capps', despite both averaging at least 94 MPH; it's only been worth -0.94 runs per hundred, while his slider is +3.05, his curve is +4.21, and his change is +3.22. Maybe Crain's offspeed stuff is simply nastier than Capps', maybe he has better command of it, maybe his fastball sets up his other stuff extremely well.

More subjectively, Capps comes right at you and even though he'll occasionally lose the battle and give up hits (especially when his BABIP sits at .319), his stuff is good enough to beat you. Crain keeps you more off balance, throwing mostly sliders and curveballs -- and he's talked about how his slider is really more like three different pitches, since he throws it at different speeds and with different breaks.

Considering all the numbers, I believe Crain is the better pitcher. But what does that say about their roles?

First, let's assume that one of the roles is going to be Closer. I don't think it necessarily should, but you know and I know that Gardy -- like most managers -- wants/needs to have a Closer sitting in the back of the bullpen. The ideal Closer is a guy like Mariano or Nathan, an elite pitcher who gets everybody out, blows them away, provides that nice warm feeling of confidence. That's the guy you _want_, but it's not always the guy you've _got_.

Since the Twins don't have that guy, who should they put there? The easy fallback answer is "best pitcher," but I've been railing for years that the best reliever shouldn't necessarily be the Closer, and I still believe it. One guy is going to allow more hits and more baserunners -- he's the guy who should come in with the bases empty, so the only runners he has to deal with are his own. One guy allows fewer hits and fewer baserunners and strikes out more batters -- he's the guy you should feel more confident dealing with other people's runners, in high-leverage situations that are not the 9th inning.

Rarely have I agreed with the way Gardy uses his bullpen; I'm the guy who thinks that a healthy Joe Nathan should be used the same way Crain is used now, and that the Fireman is a more valuable role than the Closer. But I hereby put the Seal Of Approval on the way Gardy's set up Capps and Crain in the bullpen. It gives the Twins their best chance to win.
