Recently Denard Span spoke with Rod Carew, and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/40878387.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUqCP:iUiacyKUnciaec8O7EyUr">had this to say coming out</a>:
<blockquote>"He said it's about being consistent and being here for 15 years," Span said. "I don't want to just be an average player or a one-year guy. I want to be a guy that when you speak of Twins outfielders, you talk about Kirby Puckett and Torii Hunter ... and then Denard Span."</blockquote>
This is yet another reason why I'm a big Denard Span Fan.

He understands what he could mean to this team, and he wants it. And I want it too. So I'm rooting for him.

Put it this way: in 2020, when you talk about Twins outfielders, I want to be able to talk about Kirby, Torii, and Denard.
