Random musings from last night's victory:

The first walkoff hit in the entire history of storied Target Field was last night. A prodigious two run blast by White Sox castoff (and future hall of famer, good roster management Ozzie) sealed the victory for the Twins.

Minnesota had some shaky pitching between starter Scott Baker, Closer Matt Capps, and ex-Closer Jon Rauch. This was not encouraging. As awesome as it was to see Thome launch a 450 foot blast onto the plaza, and then get a shaving cream pie in the face from Rauch, a shaky starter and bullpen had be worried. Capps is still leaps and bounds better than Rauch, and I will feel confident if Gardy puts him in to close out a ballgame tonight.

Does anyone else have zero confidence in Baker right now? I know he was impressive against the Rays two starts ago, but his last two have been very bad. Is this someone you want starting in the playoffs? Essentially throwing a reliever out there who is a crapshoot? I do not. Granted we have to GET to the playoffs first, and that is no guarantee. We have seven games left against Texas, including four in Arlington. Those certainly won't be a cakewalk. We have three left in Chicago, out side of those ten games nothing on the schedule really has me shaking in my boots. If I were to wear boots.

I hate to me Mr. Negative after such an awesome win, but I think it is always important to remember where we were last year (6.5 out of first, in third place) and keep in mind that a team can get white hot for five weeks and do anything. We can't take our foot off the pedal here, kick them while they are down, etc.
