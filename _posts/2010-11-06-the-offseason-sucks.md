The world series has been over for a week or so, and I'm already going through baseball withdrawal.  I've been thinking about what the Twins should do this offseason, as there are many pending free agents and options to deal with. The team already picked up Kubel's option, and declined Punto's.  Both moves were pretty close to no-brainers.

The bullpen has the potential for big turnover. Rauch, Crain, Guerrier, Flores, Mahay, and Fuentes are all free agents. Crain should get pretty significant interest from other teams to be a closer.  I'm sure the Twins will attempt to keep Crain, Guerrier, and Rauch, but they rightfully won't overpay.  I hope.

Orlando Hudson also seems to be a goner. Per his contract the Twins cannot offer him arbitration, so he will most likely get a multi year offer form someone.  One of my biggest concerns is who will play second base.  I was pretty impressed with Trevor Plouffe in his limited time with the club in 2010. So I hope he gets a good look in spring training.

Another big question mark is Thome. He will definitely garner a lot of interest around the AL, and I hope the Twins make a run at him.  However, with Morneau back, and the Kubel option already picked up, where would he get at bats?

Also, here is another thought to marinate: Trade Cuddyer and use the money to beef up the starting pitching.  I think we should make a serious run at Josh Johnson, or (more realistically)  Ricky Nolasco. Think about it.
