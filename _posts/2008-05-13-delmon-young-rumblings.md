It's time to continue grumbling about Delmon Young. He played all 162 games last year, and has played every game so far this year. That's admirable ... but at the same time, he's not producing. Despite getting two hits last night, he came up short in perhaps his most important at bat -- bases loaded, nobody out. An RBI Fielder's Choice is not what we want out of our prized young slugger in that situation.

But is the Young Delmon in danger of riding the pine?
<blockquote>"He told me the other day, he doesn't like to miss an inning," Gardenhire said. "And I told him to get some hits, and he won't."</blockquote>
It sure sounds like Gardy's noticed that Delmon isn't living up to his hyped hitting ability. He has only 4 XBH so far this season (including 0 HR), for a IsoP of just .036 -- which is shockingly Tyner-esque. (Last year, Tyner's IsoP was .069.)

So while Gardy wants him to "get some hits," I don't think that's the message that needs to be sent. Delmon answered by getting some singles, and raising his average to .271 ... but the real problem is that he needs to put a charge into the ball. Delmon needs to be crushing line drives and putting the ball over the fence.

Would benching be a viable option? Would it do what we want, and light a fire under his ass? Would it have the same effect it had on Gomez? Or would it anger Delmon, starting a player-manager fight in the same vein as Young v. Maddon a year ago?

It's impossible to say. But something needs to change, and I'm an advocate of sitting him down and telling him that if you want to be in the lineup, you have to produce. Just take it easy for a day, and when you come back start swinging harder -- we don't need our young players taking bat-speed lessons from Mauer (while ignoring the strike zone lessons, apparently).
