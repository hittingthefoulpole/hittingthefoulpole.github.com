That had to be the most pathetic 6 run outburst I've ever seen. We should have score at least 10 runs.  5 double plays? 21 runners we left on base. 5 by Redmond, 5 by Harris. 4 by Young. That is just downright terrible. Turrrrrible.  I just don't get how we had 11 hits off Nate Robertson, and managed to only score 6 runs.  Granted this team is average about 1.5-2 runs below that on the season, but I'm sure they also average well under 11 hits a game. Especially against a lefty.

On to the bright spots. The "Rabbits" as Dick Bremer was calling them last night looked good. Gomez, Casilla, and Span combined for 6 hits, a sac bunt, and a stolen base.  I guess its better than the Pirhannas, but thats only because I hate Nick Punto and Jason Tyner. Not anything against them personally, they just weren't (or aren't) good at baseball.

Baker looked good, his pitch count was a little high, 100 pitches in 6 innings. I believe he only had about 80 going into the 6th. Giving up two runs while throwing 20 pitches late in a close games doesn't help the cause to stay in another inning. It was a good idea to take him out.  I really like the way Baker and Slowey are throwing the ball now.  The rotation seems to be shaping up nicely.  I'm over counting on Liriano anymore. As far as I'm concerned, this is the rotation we have to ride to a playoff berth. If Bill Smith and the Twins Brain Trust (not to be confused with Kevin McHale and the Timberwolves Band of Idiots) decide to add an effective starter, whether that is Liriano or some other dude, great. If not, I can live with 4 out of 5 guys in the rotation.  I think Livan still has SOME trade value, not much, but if it comes down to it, and we need a spot for Liriano I think we have to dump Livan. I think we have had this discussion before, but of all the pitchers on the 25 man roster, Livan is the only one I can safely say is a non-factor for the Twins future. You can say Brian Bass, but he has been an effective middle relief guy who is cheap, so might as well keep him around. Boof is still young and has some value.  Livan is just a filler, and I don't think the team ever had any intention of bringing him back next year. Unless of course he put up Johan numbers or something.

Blackburn is up against Bonine (who is a righty) at 12:10 today.  Lets go for the series win.
