LEN3 is <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/">reporting</a> the Boof is done for at least six months, but probably the year.  What we all thought was severe tendinitis, is actually a torn labrum and rotator cuff.  How in the hell did we get that wrong?  The two MRIs he had showed no damage, now we get this.  Quite the shocker.  I wonder if this will motivate the team to make a harder push for Cruz.  On the flip-side, I hope it doesn't cause them to push TOO hard and give up too much.
