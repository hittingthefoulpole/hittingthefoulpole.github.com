Well, now that we officially have Joe Crede for a very reasonable 2.5 million, where does he bat in the lineup.  I like having Morneau bat cleanup, and Mauer obviously isn't moving from the 3-hole.  While I think Kubel is a good fit to bat fifth, I think its best to separate the lefties.  Plug Crede in fifth, slide Kubel to sixth.  I'd probably bat Young/Cuddyer seventh followed by Punto and Gomez.  I could see Gardy flip-flopping Crede with Young/Cuddyer, it probably depends on how everyone does in the spring. 

We have discussed the 25 man roster many times in this space.  So now with the addition of Crede, which player does not make the cut?  My guess is Buscher.  He really isn't very useful as a bench player.  Harris will make the team because he can play several positions, same probably goes for Tolbert.  All five of the outfielders (Gomez, Span, Young, Cuddyer, Kubel) should be safe.  At this point it is probably a toss up between Tolbert and Buscher.  I konw Gardy loves him some scrappy utility infielders who can't really hit, so Tolbert might have the edge to make the squad. What do you guys think?  Where will Gardy bat Crede, who gets bumped off the 25 man roster due to the Crede signing?
