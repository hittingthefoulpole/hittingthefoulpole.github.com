The Twins have a very big (for May) series with the Yankees coming up this weekend.  We have not been treated too kindly by the big kid on the AL block, last year the Twins went 0-10 against the Bombers.  Gardenhire has only beaten them something like six times in his career.

During the Gardy era, the twins are 2-9 against the Yankees in the postseason alone.  The Yankees always field at least a competitive team, usually a great one.  They have won 27 World Series for godssake, so we aren't exactly the only ones who can't beat them in the playoffs.

This probably isn't so much a stigma, as it is the Yankees are flat out better.  However one would think that we should be able to luck into a victory now and then.  Some will argue that this is Gardy's fault.  That he somehow doesn't have his players convinced they can win.  Now, since this site used to be called firegardy.com, we don't have a lot of nice things to say about Ol' Ron, but I will say this: Gardy will never allow his team to lose because they don't think they can win.  He has MANY flaws, but letting his players think they have lost before the first pitch isn't one of them. 

What do you all think? Do we seemingly lose to the Yankees every time we play them simply because they are the better team? I would say that explains 7 out of every 10 times we lose.  Why do we lose the other three?  Are we scared of the pinstripes? Despite what I may think of Gardy, does he not properly prepare our players to face the Yankees? This is a big weekend series, and we don't have to face CC, so I think we have to win 2. I know that is a tall order since it is infinity percent more wins than we had last year, but its a good goal to shoot for. We play them again at Target Field in less than 2 weeks.  Is splitting a 6 game series considered a victory against these guys? Or should we treat them like we treat every other team in that it is only a victory if we actually win more games against them than we lose?
