I must admit, I'm a huge fan of Posnanski's latest ongoing feature, So How About This. Know what else I'm a fan of? That he's basically got a Mauer Watch going, as he brings up Mauer as one of the absurd stats every week when he writes the post.

<a href="http://joeposnanski.com/JoeBlog/2009/06/16/so-how-about-this-3/">This week?</a>
<blockquote>So how about this: Joe Mauer, his last six games, is 11 for 26. Heâ€™s had a hit every game, two hits in three of those games, and three hits in one game. In those six games, he has raised his average from .413 to .414.

THAT is how hard it is to hit .400 for a season.</blockquote>
Firstly, I'm going to be honest. It's felt like Mauer's been slumping lately.

Secondly, I think there's no better way to explain exactly how difficult it is to hit .400 for a season. Sure, Mauer struggled a little bit this week, and he was sick. But he also went 11 for 26 with a home run. For most players, that puts them in the running for player of the week.

For Mauer, though, it's just hovering.
