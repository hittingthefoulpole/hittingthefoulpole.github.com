Today the Twins activated Mauer from the 15 day DL and <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/05/01/mauer-activated-morillo-sent-down/">assigned</a> Juan Morillo to Rochester.  LEN3 mentions nothing of Morillo having to clear waivers for this move, I was under the impression that he had to. 

This is a decent move.  If Gardy was willing to let Morillo pitch in blowout games to hone his control, I would say we should have kept him.  Since this is not the case, at least he will get a lot of work in down in Rochester with the Cliburns, which never hurt anyone.
