I know everyone's ornery today because Gleeman is having another of those <a href="http://www.aarongleeman.com/2009_01_25_baseballblog_archive.html#7760629578958896676">stupid live chats rather than actually penning an article</a>. So let's just get to some news, shall we?

The <a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/bob-cubs-sold/">Cubs have been sold</a>, for $900M, to some rich guy who claims to be a Cubs fan. Apparently, my request for a government bailout of $4 billion was ignored. (My reasoning was: "If you don't give me free billions, I won't be a billionaire!" This is the logic that puts taxpayer money into the pockets of rich guys in the form of "stadiums" or the more egregious "stay rich cash infusion.") If I <em>had</em> gotten that well-deserved money, I certainly would have bid more than $900M to own the Cubs. Which would have been "good" for the economy. Yet another unforgivable screw up. I'm still waiting for that check.

In other Cubs news, they're suing Under Armour. I, um, don't know what to say about this other than that it's probably not your underwear's fault. If you know what I mean.

A little while back, <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=8427">Brendan Harris was interviewed</a> by Baseball Prospectus. Their Q&amp;A sessions with players aren't often very interesting; the players tend to spew the same cliched crap they give to regular media people. However, I learned that Harris has a degree in political science and actually seems like a pretty smart guy.

He revealed that he spends most of his time talking to Slowey and Breslow, and that Cuddyer occasionally tries to join the conversation. Slowey and Breslow are generally regarded as the smartest guys on the team, so it's no surprise that another smart guy would gravitate towards them -- though they have talent, which Harris lacks.

He was asked to compare Gardy to Joe Maddon:
<blockquote>They're two different guys with two different styles, albeit both successful. Joe is more of the professor type where he's very analytical, although he will definitely get intense, too. He is more of a "thinks things through" [type]. Gardy is a little more emotional and really gets into the game. Sometimes you almost can't tell if Gardy is out there playing or if he's managing. He wears it on his sleeve a little more.</blockquote>
Now, there's really nothing there that's not obvious ... but I will say that I have never been confused about whether Gardy is playing or managing. I've been confused as to whether he's managing or <em>not</em> managing, but ... playing? Really? But I do like it that Gardy's emotional -- it makes for better pictures. See the logo at the top of the page.

They finished with this:
<blockquote><strong>DL:</strong> I can't let you get away without bringing up that you were once compared, as a minor league prospect, to <span class="playerdef">Albert Pujols</span>.

<strong>BH:</strong> Oh, man. Let's put it this way: If that was a diagnosis, I'd say, 'Doctor, you were way off base on that one.'</blockquote>
Looks like we got the wrong infielder. And I would like to know who ever compared Harris to Pujols, and whether they still have a job.

And to finish, I'd just like to point out that however much other teams are complaining about the "economy" getting them down and constraining their wallets, <a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/shysterball/article/the-twins-are-healthy/">the Twins are doing just fine</a>. The team is on pace to sell a franchise record 11000 season tickets for 2009, and they have this to say about their financials:
<blockquote>“We’re in a unique situation with the new ballpark on the horizon, the last year in the Metrodome, a very competitive team and a great value proposition in terms of flexibility and affordability,” said Steve Smith, the Twins’ vice president of ticket sales and service. “In some respects, I think we’re riding above some of the economic pain that some other organizations are feeling right now.”</blockquote>
Well, personally, I think that's great. It's certainly good to hear that we're doing well, which is more enjoyable than the schadenfreude of hearing that the Mets ownership was taken to the cleaners by Madoff.

So I guess it's a good thing the Twins are one of the few teams doing well financially this offseason. You can really tell by the way they're throwing their money around.
