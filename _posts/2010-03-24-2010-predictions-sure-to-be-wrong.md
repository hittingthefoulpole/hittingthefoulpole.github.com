Well, we're less than two weeks away from Opening Day, so it is time to make 2010 projections.  I'm going to do division winner, playoff winners, and league MVP and Cy Young award winners.  Feel free to leave your predictions in the comments section, or yell at me if you think I'm wrong.

<strong>American League:</strong>

West: Rangers.  I think they have the pitching to win, and if Hamilton stays healthy their offense will score enough runs to support said pitching.

Central: Twins.  This is the best lineup they've had in years, and the starting rotation is solid, if unspectacular.  Having Pavanoand Slowey for an entire season won't force Ron Gardenhire to start a string of AAAA players in important stretch run games.

East: Yankees.  If it ain't broke.....

Wild Card: Angels.  It was a toss up for the west crown, and I think the big boys of the AL east will beat up on each other enough to let the Angels take the wild card.

MVP: Joe Mauer.  I'm tempted to pick Texiera, but I guess I'm too much of a homer.  It will be another close one, especially if A-Rod plays the full season.

Cy Young: CC Sabbathia.  I think the voters will revert to the "ooh, look at all those wins" style of voting, which will preventGrienke from winning his second in a row.

<strong>National League</strong>

West: Rockies. If they can get their closer situation figured out, they should have no problem winning the division.  The return of Jeff Francis will more than offset the loss of Jason Marquis.

Central: Cardinals.  They have two of the best starters in the NL headlining their rotation, and the best hitter of my generation.  I can't find a reason to pick against them.

East: Phillies. Roy Halladay might actually win 30 games in his switch to the NL.  The Marlins and Braves could challenge them for a while, but the Phillies will pull away by midseason.

Wild Card: Marlins.  Josh Johnson is a legitimate ace, and Ricky Nolasco should see his ERA take a large dip due to his good peripheral numbers.  Hanley Ramierz anchors a young, but talented offense.  Florida can win a lot of games on the strength of their starting pitching.

Cy Young: Josh Johnson. The two cards pitchers will take votes away from each other, gift wrapping the award for Johnson

MVP:  Albert Pujols. He's a machine.

<strong>Playoffs:</strong>

<strong>LDS</strong>

Yankees over Angels

Twins over Rangers

Cards over Marlins

Phillies over Rockies

<strong>LCS</strong>

Twins over Yankees.  (I know, I know)

Phillies over Cards

<strong>World Series</strong>

I'm not going to  venture a guess.

So there you go.  What do you guys think?
