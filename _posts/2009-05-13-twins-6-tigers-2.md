Clete Thomas should know better than to try and rob Joe Mauer twice in one game.  In an unusual display of power so far, Mauer has blasted 4 homers so far this season.  Which is excellent. 

The Mauer and Crede homers gave Kevin Slowey a nice lead to work with for most of his 6 innings.  He only gave up the one run but struggled.  He seemingly couldn't get the leadoff man out.  Slowey threw 98 pitches in 6 innings, so everyone knew Gardy wasn't going to let him out there for the 7th.  Instead he brought in Jesse Crain because he hadn't given up a homer all year, the only pitcher to accomplish that feat.  Well apparently he got lonely in that club so he served one up to someone named Jeff Larish.  He also threw 11 pitches, only 4 were for strikes.  <em>FOUR!  </em>What the hell is that?

As was the case in the weekend series, the Twins drew lots of walks.  7 in this game.  The only people who didn't draw a walk were Span (which is a surprise), Young (which isn't) and Crede.  Cred had a homer and Span had two hits, so its OK.  

Mauer had another superhuman game.  Was 2-3 with a homer (almost 2) 2 RBI, 1 run, and a walk.  His average now sits at an even 500.  Looks as if he got his revenge on the Tigers for playing poorly against them last week.

Outside of Crain the bullpen look fine.  Mijares got some big outs, as did Guerrier.  Nathan looked excellent as always while pitching a perfect ninth.

One criticism is I would like for us to cut down on strikeouts while we increase our walk totals.  The team struck out a total of 8 times, including 2 each by Span and Tolbert.

Tonight we face the man formally known as D-Train.  Hopefully we can tee off on him early and often.  He was on the DL with "anxiety" problems.  Translate that as inability to get anyone out.   Hopefully Harris is in the lineup tonight.  Dick and Bert interviewed him from the dugout last night and I commend him for not wanting to go Kyle Lohse on people while losing playing time to Punto, Casilla and Tolbert. 

Is anyone else frustrated that Gardy has turned Gomez into nothing more than a late inning defensive replacement for Young?  I like Delmon more than most people, probably more than anyone (here is a <a href="http://tenthinningstretch.blogspot.com/2009/05/delmon-young-bust-or-not.html">piece</a> by intelligent firegardy.com reader thrylos98.)  Gomez has too much damn potential to be rotting away on a bench to get at most 4 at bats a week.
