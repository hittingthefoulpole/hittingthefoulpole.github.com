So Matt Garza pulled himself from the (Devil) Rays game the other day in the third inning, claiming some sort of radial nerve issue. He also claims he was throwing with said issue all of last year. This brings up a thorny issue.  If the Twins knew about it they owe the Rays compensation, which is usually cash or draft picks.  My question is how do they prove this.  I'm assuming team doctors keep records of all the players, just like regular doctors. So does MLB have access to the twins medical files? Wouldn't these records change hands as part of the physical most trades are contingent upon?

Here is my professional guess: Garza was pretty desperate to make the major league team last season. There was no way in hell he would have disclosed an injury if it meant derailing his path to the big leagues. I think he either didn't tell the team, or the injury didn't surface until after the trade. Either way, it could get ugly.
