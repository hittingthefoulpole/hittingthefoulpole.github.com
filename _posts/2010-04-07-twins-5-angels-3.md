I was a bit nervous going into this game, as starting the season off 0-2, while not the end of the world, would have caused a lot of complaints to be heard.

Joe Mauer started things off with a bang, blasting a two run homer for his first of the season.  The Twins offense looked locked in, hitting the ball all over the place against lefty Joe Saunders. Unfortunately they were unable to really slam the door, scoring just 3 in the first. 

The Twins tacked on single runs in the third and fourth, on homers by Morneau and JJ Hardy to take a 5-1 lead.  Despite Torii Hunter's best efforts, the Angels were unable to break through and Minnesota held on for a 5-3 win. 

Nick Blackburn was his usual self.  6 2/3 giving up 3 earned runs.  His walk total was uncharacteristically high, but I'm willing to chalk that up to nerves. Or the fact that he was intimidated by all the people in the crowd wearing snuggies.

The bullpen, a big question mark going into the season,  was literally perfect in relief of Blackburn.  As Gleeman pointed out on Twitter (@aarongleeman): "See, now if there was such thing as a 'save' the Twins would probably leave Guerrier in for the ninth".  I couldn't agree more.  Guerrier got out of the 8th throwing just 11 pitches (7 for strikes) and looked like he easily could have mowed down the Angels in the ninth.  But, Gardy has to have his "closer" rack up "saves".  Oh well, it seemed to work out as Rauch struck out two in a perfect ninth.

When was the last time the Twins score all of their multiple runs on homers?  I'm sure it has actually happened fairly recently, but it still surprises me.

What did everyone else think of the Twins first win in 2010?
