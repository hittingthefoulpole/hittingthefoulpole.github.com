It really feels good to beat a division rival. It feels even better to beat a pitcher who has really had our  number over the years.  It always seems like Mark Buehrle flat out dominates us, much like every other lefty in the league.

I don't think I can say enough good things about Slowey. He flat out dominated the White Sox lineup. Although they all seem to have a terrible average, there are still more good hitters than bad ones in that batting order. In my opinion. He seemed to throw a first pitch strike to every batter. He worked the inside half of the plate very well, something it seems our pitchers don't do.  He kept his pitch count very low, his strike to ball ratio was slightly above 2:1, which is great.  He averaged about 11 pitches per inning, and never really seemed to be in trouble. It helped that the offense gave him a nice lead in the third inning, but like I said, some of those white sox bats are capable of tying a game with one swing.

I was sitting first row behind the plate last night and noticed that home plate umpire Kerwin Danley was VERY inconsistent. It didn't favor one team or the other, his strike zone was just bad all around. Couple that with the third base ump making an atrocious call on the Dye "homer", and the first base ump calling Casilla safe when Konerko clearly made the tag, it was a bad night for the umpires last night. Considering we will have the same crew for four games, this could get very frustrating.

Good to see the lefties hitting Buehrle well. Span and Morneau had nice homers. On Span's Sox CF Nick Swisher lost his glove over the center field fence while trying to make a leaping grab. A for effort Nick, but you weren't really that close.

The two teams also seemed to play nice with one another. Gardy and Ozzie got in some tussels with the umps over the aforementioned blown calls (at least the one that hurt us was overturned, I'm guessing the officiating crew was not going to overturn two calls in one game) but there was beanball incidents or staredowns over an inside pitch. Good to see that, although I really want to see a baseball brawl live sometime in my life.

Thoughts on the game or the rapidly approaching trade deadline?
