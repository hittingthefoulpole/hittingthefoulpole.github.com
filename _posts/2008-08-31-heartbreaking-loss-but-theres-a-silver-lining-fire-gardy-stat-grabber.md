Last night Nathan blew another save, and got the loss when he threw a ball past Harris and allowed the tying and winning runs to score, turning a 2-1 lead into a 3-2 walkoff loss.

That's two walkoff losses in the last three games. Unacceptable.

And it wasted another great start by Liriano, who had yet <em>another</em> chance to pitch us back into first. (By the way, does it seem to anyone else that every time he pitches, we're 1/2 game out?)

But I don't want to talk about that today. If you look to the right side of the page, you should see something new: Nick Punto's stats are displayed in the sidebar.

That's part of a new program we've added to Fire Gardy, called (creatively) the "Fire Gardy Stat Grabber." It reaches out to Baseball-Reference.com and downloads the stats for a player and displays them on any Wordpress blog. So if you want to put someone's stats on your own blog, head over to the <a href="http://stat-grabber.firegardy.com">Fire Gardy Stat Grabber</a> page and download it.

More importantly ... I don't know if we want to just display Punto's stats. When we opened the doors here at Fire Gardy, my co-founder FunBobby came up with the idea of showing Punto's stats on the site as a tribute to his still getting playing time despite a lack of ability. The thing is ... he's producing about as well as could be hoped. As you can see, he's currently got a 100 OPS+, which is more than adequate from a utility infielder.

So! We should probably display some other players on here. Who should go on there? (Major limitation: Hitters only for now.)

Delmon Young? Adam Everett? Denard Span? Carlos Gomez? Torii Hunter?

I'll take any suggestions and decide who gets the honor of having their stats displayed on the sidebar. And we can have any number of players over there, there's no limit.

And now, hopefully we can score some runs today and save a split against the lowly A's.
