LaVelle is really going crazy with winter meetings updates. Awesome. Although, it's a pretty slow work day today for some reason; I could do with some more updates.

But I'll have to make do with what I've got for now. And in <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2008/12/09/morning-news-and-notes-from-las-vegas/">one of LaVelle's recent updates</a>, he mentioned a couple of interesting things.
<blockquote>There is one report that Nick Punto met with the Phillies yesterday. If that’s true, Punto could indirectly help the Twins because he could be insurance for Chase Utley and Pedro Feliz, who are coming back from surgeries. That might help the Twins’ efforts to pry Jason Donald away. Just my theory.

Was told that Phillies manager Charlie Manuel is very fond of Punto.</blockquote>
Very interesting. We couldn't make progress in Jason Donald talks because the Phillies wanted insurance for their middle infield ... and the much-maligned utility infielder could come in on some sort of shining white horse and save the day? Hilarious!

Well, that's one way to look at it. The other way is this one:

We'd been trying unsuccessfully to trade a 22 year old who hit .290/.336/.405 in the American League for a 23 year old who hit .307/.391/.497 at AA. Both players are sub-par defensively, though the elder minor leaguer fails at a more valuable defensive position. The trade talks had stalled because the Phillies over-value their possession while realizing that the Twins greatly under-value theirs ... which means the Phillies think they can drive down the price to acquire a needed replacement bat in LF that'll be around for years and probably dominate in that lineup and ballpark. They make up an excuse about middle infield depth to make it seem like they're not just trying to drive down the price for Delmon. Then Nick F'ing Punto comes along and says "Hey, you know what? I'll do my best friend Ron Gardenhire a favor and help him get rid of Delmon Young! I know how much Gardy hates that talented jerk (who wouldn't hate someone with talent, after all?), so this will really help the team by making Gardy happy!" At least I presume that's what he said right before walking in the door to his meeting with the Phillies.

Oh, and for those who think Donald's AA numbers look good, consider this: When Delmon Young was at AA, he was just 19 years old (which is a lot younger than 23 for that level) and hit <em>.336/.386/.582</em> (which is, obviously, a whole lot better than .307/.391/.497). Seriously, are we just trying to do something stupid?

From the same notebook:
<blockquote>There are a lot of people here who think Twins’ first-round pick Aaron Hicks is an uber prospect. Some still think highly of him as a pitcher - he did hit 97 on the gun as a senior in high school. The Twins drafted him as an outfielder.</blockquote>
I've been pretty pleased with Hicks so far, and it's cool to hear that he's highly regarded around the league. He's only 18 and hasn't even gotten to A ball yet, so he's years away. I suppose this means we won't be able to make any trades at all, since everyone will just demand Hicks and Slowey for every castaway over-the-hill dead-weight loser on their roster.

Also, does anyone else feel like the Twins' outfield situation in 2011 will be a lot more ridiculous than it is now, given that Revere and Hicks (and maybe the rest) will be blooming just as Gomez and Span hit arbitration, and Young is (hopefully) still around?
