Today's an eventful day for Ron Gardenhire.

He finished second in the voting for AL Manager of the Year, behind Joe Maddon. Gardy probably deserved to be second place just about as much as Maddon deserved to be first; ie, completely. I can't think of any problems with it. Except ... Maddon got 27 of 28 first place votes, and Gardy got 1. What's the big deal, you say?
<blockquote>There has never been a unanimous winner for Manager of the Year. (<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3698490">ESPN</a>)</blockquote>
Oh. Oh boy. Is it possible that the newly minted Ray Nation will inexplicably get angry about this? <a href="http://blogs.tampabay.com/rays/2008/11/pluto-defends-v.html">Yes they can</a>. The single vote came from a sportswriter in Cleveland, who was then accosted by TampaBay.com, and essentially reneged his vote:
<blockquote>"The voting is done in the final week of the season, so I did not have the playoffs to consider," Pluto said. "If they did the voting after, certainly Joe would have got it."</blockquote>
I think that's exactly why they do the voting before the playoffs -- because it's Manager of the <em>Year</em>, not Manager of <em>October</em>. But I have no gripes. He can say he'd like to take his vote back all he wants to. It seems that's a rare opinion though, as Pluto is suffering plenty of hate mail.
<blockquote>Pluto said he's trying to respond to every email he's received, which have included a one-word, "Idiot," and even some from fans in Cleveland who love his work but were wowed by his vote

"One guy wrote, 'I usually like your stuff, but what were you thinking? You're making me embarrassed to be from Cleveland."</blockquote>
Seriously? <em>This</em> is what makes you embarrassed to be from Cleveland? 

Oh, and in other Gardy-related news, he <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2008/11/13/gardenhire-gets-two-year-extension/">finally got his extension</a>. Good for him. As expected, it's a two year deal, and also as expected, it wasn't officially announced until all his coaches also got a two year contract extension. That's right folks. Ullger is now signed through 2010. Vavra will still be our hitting coach and Castellano is still the strength and conditioning coach -- so don't expect any more power.

I appreciate the loyalty shown here by Gardy and the Twins organization. But at what point is it clear that Ullger, Vavra, and Castellano aren't getting it done? We have performance metrics for the players, and even the manager (he has a 622-512 record), but we get nothing for these coaches and trainers, who have a huge impact on the abilities of the players to perform and the manager to win.

I demand satisfaction!

Also, congratulations Gardy.
