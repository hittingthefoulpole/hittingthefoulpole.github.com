Well, my hand has been hovering over the big red panic button for days now.  I think I'm ready to push it. The offense doesn't worry me too much, we have the pieces we just need to get them clicking at the same time. A right handed bat would help, but Smith should be using every piece of ammo he has to get an elite starting pitchers (Cliff Lee or maybe Dan haren).  The bullpen has been shocking decent. It is the starting rotation that is just downright bad.

Nick Blackburn is not a good pitcher. Any pitcher who relies on pitching to contact is a ticking timebomb.  So instead of trading him after two solid years, the twins sign him to a contract extension? I was puzzeld then, but everyone said "he is solid and consistent! its a great move!".  Now I have the evidence to say this: Look you idiots! He isn't a good pitcher, that was a fucking horrible move to lock up a pitcher who is only going to get worse when you don't need to.  The bum was under team control anyway. His FIP was always higher than his ERA, except this year because his ERA is 6! Can't really get higher than that.

So I have this to say to Bill Smith: Do whatever it takes to trade for Cliff Lee, and in the meantime get blackburn out of the rotation.  Are we really willing to let him "try to right the ship" again tonight? When a loss puts us even further back. Unacceptable.

That is all.  Sorry about the infrequent posting.  I know I have been busy at my real job, which sadly is infinitely more important than the blog since it, you know, pays my mortgage. I'm assuming Sean is busy as well.
