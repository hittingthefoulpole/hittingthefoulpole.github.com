Well we have reached the all-star break with the twins just 1.5 games behind the white sox. This is surprising because everyone predicted the Twins would be behind not only Chicago, but Cleveland and Detroit as well.  The club really benefited from two weeks of beating up the pathetic national league in June.  We also have a winning record despite a pretty poor run differential, and Livan Hernandez.  He is on pace to have one of the worst seasons by a starting pitcher. I believe he has allowed 1.5 baserunners per inning so far this season. Wow. Also remember Boof made a handful of atrocious starts in the first few months. Despite all these things, we are still in it. Thanks to timely hitting, I believe the Twins lead the AL in batting with RISP.

Some issues I think the team should address for the second half stretch run.  Carlos Gomez. I think he needs to be removed from the leadoff spot due to his inability to actually get on base. He doesn't work the count, he doesn't draw walks, he just seems to be a strikeout machine. Not something you want in a leadoff hitter. I say try Casilla there.  Next up, Livan. He has 9 wins, but that is pretty meaningless considering the rest of his stats are just plain awful. It seems like the team is OK with that, so then who will be the odd man out when Liriano comes back this month? Perkins maybe?  There is also a general consensus that we need another relief arm. I'm not sure what we have in rochester, but I would like to have a power reliever to take some of the late inning workload off of Nathan, Guerrier and Crain.  If Liriano takes Perkins' spot, I'm sure they will just move Perkins into the bullpen, but I like him as a starter, not a reliever.  Brian Bass is not the answer, he is <strong>at best</strong>a low leverage situation mop-up man. Not a replacement for Neshek. 

There have been rumblings about Adrian Beltre, who I guess is available. He is an OK player, but I don't know if I want him and his 12MM pricetag. Buscher has been playing well and I don't think it will help anything to move him to the bench or back to Rochester.

What else does the team need to do to make a playoff run in the second half? Let's hear (or read I guess) your thoughts.
