Now that he has locked up the MVP, lets start discussing specifics of a possible Joe Mauer Contract extension, and any other offseason moves.  This is the first time I've attempted anything like this so it probably won't work.  In the comments section, leave you suggestion for what the Twins should be offering Mauer and any other musings you have in regards to offseason moves.

Remaining needs to be filled

A second or thirdbaseman

One or two mid rotation starters

some bullpen help.

In the comments let me know if you agree, or disagree, or have specific players in mind to fill these and any other holes.  We are approaching the winter meetings, so lets give Bill Smith some suggestions.
