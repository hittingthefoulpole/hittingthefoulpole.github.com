After Joe Nathan went down in early March, everyone and their mother seemed to be worried about the Twins bullpen.  All of a sudden the Twins went from a World Series contender to an AL Central also-ran because one guy got hurt.  I didn't buy it.  I didn't think the loss of Nathan would cost the Twins more than a few wins and jack up everyone's blood pressure.  So, instead of talking about how awesome our fifth starter is, I thought I'd take this chance to update everyone on how each member of our "weak link" bullpen has been doing so far.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4682&amp;position=P"><strong>Pat Neshek</strong></a>

Neshek has pitched 4.1 innings (in 5 games), with a solid 8.31 K/9, a 0.00 ERA, and a 1.92 FIP.  He hasn't allowed a homer yet, and his WAR is 0.1.  He has an unsustainably low BABIP of .196.  I expect that to rise, along with his ERA, but I think his strikeout and walk rates at levels he can maintain.  He hasn't seen much action,  so I'd like Gardy to run him out a little more often. Overall, I'm pressed with Neshek's first few Major League outings in roughly two years.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=290&amp;position=P"><strong>Ron Mahay</strong></a>

Mahay was a late addition to the pen and was brought in to take the spot of the injured Clay Condrey. Mayhay has pitched in 5 games, tossing 5.1 innings. He has a really high K/9 of 11.12, and his BABIP is a a little low at .250.  He has a good GB% of 50%.  Expect his ERA and FIP to increase from their insanely low leves, and I bet he gets most of the LOOGY duties is Mijares remains injured/bad and Duensing is forced into the rotation.  So far Mahay has faced nearly identical numbers of lefties and righties,  looking pretty similar facing both. 

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=2061&amp;position=P"><strong>Matt Guerrier</strong></a>

The longtime workhorse of the Twins bullpen, seems to be in that role again this year.  He appeared in 10 games so far this season, throwing 11.1 innings.  Like the rest of the Twins relievers he has a low BABIP, and has managed to stay away from the longball.  His strikeout rates are pretty low, but he has never really been a big time strikeout machine. Groundball rate of 41% is solid, if not spectacular.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1475&amp;position=P"><strong>Jon Rauch</strong></a>

Rauch was probably the biggest question mark going into this season.  He had pretty big shoes to fill, and has done so prett admirably.  He has converted 7/8 saves opportunities, pitching a total of 10 innings.  He got the win after blowing his only saves.  His .321 BABIP is pretty high, so that might regress a little bit over the course of the season, and his GB% of 45% is  pretty good.  Compared to Nathan, his k/9 is pretty piss poor.  It currently sits at 6.30, relief pitchers, especially closers, need to strike hitters out at a better rate than that.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4064&amp;position=P"><strong>Brian Duensing</strong></a>

Duensing made the team and was expected to pitching in a long relief role for most of the season. There haven't been too many opportunities for him to pitch multiple innings, he has appeared in 8 games, pitching 9 innings.  He is 2-0, with an average BABIP, and a high GB% (59.3).  His K/9 is in line with his career average, and his BB/9 is very low (1.00).  His ERA and FIP are pretty close (2.00 vs 2.63) so that is encouraging. What we see is what we get from Duensing.  He isn't a spectacular pitcher, but he is a very capable lefty reliever.  Of the 8 hits he has given up, only one was against a lefty.  If Blackburn continues to be hurt or struggles I think Duensing is the logical choice to move into the rotation for a while.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4065&amp;position=P"><strong>Alex Burnett</strong></a>

Called up to replace injured, terrible lefty Jose Mijares, Burnett has looked pretty good.  He has appeared in 5 games, striking out a ton of guys over his 7.1 innings.  GB% is a little low at 35.3%.  I imagine he is the first on the chopping block when Mijares comes back, although he has looked better than Mijares and I'm not sure we need 3 lefties in the bullpen.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4817&amp;position=P"><strong>Jesse Crain</strong></a>

One of my least favorite pitchers over the years, Crain is kind of an annoying relief pitcher.  He looks good when he comes in with the bases empty, but can't seem to take care of business if there are runners on.  That isn't exactly a great quality in a middle reliever/setup man.  Crain's K/9 is in line with his career average so far, his BABIP sits at .323, so I expect that to come down. His GB%  (29.2%) is quite a bit below his career average (46.5%).  I don't see him going anywhere, and I expect him to be an average pitcher most of the year.  He will look pretty good when nobody is on base, and he will struggle if he is asked to get out of other people's jams.

<strong>Jose Mijares</strong>

Screw him. He sucks.

The one thing that stands out to me is the lack of homers the bullpen has given up.  Crain has one, Mijares three, and nobody else has given one up.  That is very impressive.
