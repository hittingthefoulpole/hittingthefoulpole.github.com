If you thought Kelly Thesier was bad, I have news for you. Her readers are worse. From <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080128&amp;content_id=2357588&amp;vkey=news_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min">today's mailbag</a>:
<blockquote> <strong>With no center fielder ready, traded for or signed, why aren't the Twins talking about moving Nick Punto there? He seems to have the natural ability to catch the ball and he's got more experience in the big leagues than a guy like Denard Span or Jason Pridie.
-- Andy S., Cincinnati, Ohio</strong>

Punto has the ability to play the outfield, including center field, but the Twins have more experienced options to use there if necessary. Craig Monroe has played a total of 77 career games in center field, Delmon Young is an option and manager Ron Gardenhire has even mentioned Michael Cuddyer as a possibility for seeing time there. The team also is willing to give Span and Pridie a chance to earn the starting spot. Punto will spend the spring competing for the second base spot and if Brendan Harris earns the job, as expected, then Punto will be back to filling in the utility infield role.</blockquote>
Fortunately for all involved, Kelly's response warms the heart. I was worried there for a moment. A bigger question is: Who is Andy S, from Cincinnati? Why does he think Punto would be a good option in CF? Why does he want Punto to get his 600 ABs? And can we trade him to the Reds?

The disheartening part of the response is that none of the options are particularly good ones. Of the players with MLB experience, Monroe is probably the best option ... and he's not a good one. (Though he's been insisting that he'll be trying to win the starting spot in CF this spring.) Other than Monroe, we've got Pridie. Great. I don't expect big things out of him. However, he'll be a lot better than Punto.

None of this probably needed to be said ... but people like Andy S from Cincinnati keep doing things like this that might encourage Gardy's addiction.
