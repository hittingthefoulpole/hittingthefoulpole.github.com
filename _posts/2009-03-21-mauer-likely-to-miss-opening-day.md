Joe Mauer <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/spring2009/news/story?id=4001148">announced</a> today that he will likely miss opening day.  This is not good for the Twins.  So, who will share catching duties with Mike Redmond for the start of the season?  My guess is either Butera or Morales.  I would choose Morales, because he is the better hitter.  The bigger question, is how will the lineup be affected?  Who will take Mauer's place batting third?  

Do you move Morneau up?  Slide one of the right handed hitters (Cuddyer or Young) in between Casilla and Morneau?  That might be the best solution.  Another option is Kubel.  This would be my choice, considering he is the third best hitter on the team, after Mauer and Morneau.  I don't feel its necessary to alternate righties and lefties, moving Kubel up makes sense.  Whoever is catching should probably be batting 7th or 8th.  Losing your #3 hitter is a terrible loss, and it probably hurts the Twins more than most teams.  However, I think this team is deep enough, that we can survive a few weeks without Mauer.  The pitching is good , and  if we get decent production out of Cuddyer and Young, we should be able to keep our heads above water. 

If Mauer's absence stretches beyond a week or two, we might be in trouble.  Having Redmond/Morales/Butera in the lineup everyday is no good.  Does anyone think if we need a better catcher for an extended period, they might allow Ramos to make the jump?  Or is there no way he will be ready to contribute in 09?  

I know this is a subject nobody wants to discuss until we absolutely have to.  Speculating about losing your starting catcher/best hitter for a long time is never fun.  So I will try to make this the last post about it.  Unless some real news breaks.
