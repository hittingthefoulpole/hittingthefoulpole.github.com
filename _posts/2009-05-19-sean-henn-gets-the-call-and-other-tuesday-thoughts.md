Perkins was <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/">placed on the disabled list </a>today, and will be replaced by Sean Henn.  Henn has appeared in 15 games for the Red Wings, pitching 24 innings, giving up 3 earned runs (but 7 unearned, ouch) with a 32/10 K/BB ratio.  That's a 12.0 K/9.  Not half bad.   His major league track record hasn't been great.  He has spent time with the Yankees and the Padres. 

Apparently Perkins was trying to pitch through elbow inflammation, which is never a good idea.  Hopefully this has been the cause of his recent May suckiness, not simply being a bad pitcher.  The bigger question is, who will replace Perkins in the rotation?  If its just one start my money is on Dickey, just like they did with Baker.  However, "elbow inflammation" never seems to last one start so they will have to call someone up.  The only pitchers in Rochester that are currently on the 40 man roster are Duensing, Armando Gabino, and Anthony Swarzak.  Duesning and Swarzak are starters so they are the two obvious choices.  Unless we want to grab someone from double A, which I would have no problem with.  It just seems that the Twins MO is to use AAA as their source for stop-gap players, only allowing players to jump from AA to the Majors if its for a full time job.

Hopefully this Sean Henn move injects some life (and by life I mean ability to get people out) into the bullpen.  I was hoping one of Slama or Delaney would be called up, but the fact that they weren't further proves my AA vs. AAA theory.  If Henn turns out to be valuable, perhaps like Breslow last year, who will the Twins part ways with when Perkins comes back?  My money is on Ayala, even though he was moderately effective last night.  He just isn't any good.

Speaking of last night, how about Dickey being basically the only reason we were still in that game.  After Perkins threw BP for 2/3 of an inning (even one of his outs was a warning track fly ball) Dickey came in for 4.1 innings and shut the Yankees down.  Impressive.  We still need to do a better job of hitting with RISP.  Maybe we should practice it more.  Oh wait, you can't do that.  I think we have finally proved that what the Twins did last year was almost entirely luck.  Its unfortunate, but I think our increased (or at least seemingly increased, I haven't looked at the stats) walk totals will help us greatly.  Especially now that Cuddyer is heating up, and Crede seems to be turning a corner. 

Brendan Harris needs more at bats.  If Gardy is going to play Tolbert as the regular second baseman, at least don't bat him second.  Have a terrible hitter breaking up our best hitters is probably one of the worst ideas ever.  Similar to Napoleon's "I can invade Russia during the winter" idea.  Or Chamberlain's "Sure Hitler, you can have the Sudetenland back".  Yes, I just compared two of the greatest political and military failures in history to Ron Gardenhire batting Matt Tolbert second.  Deal with it.

Leave your suggestions for Perkins rotation replacements in the comments.  Please, no more discussion of the Yankee series.  Let's just go to Chicago and kick some White Sox ass.
