What the hell was that?

Hovechar pretty much couldn't throw a strike to save his life in the first few innings, yet we still couldn't get a hit, let alone a run.  Blackburn pitched reasonably well, but if we don't give him any semblance of support we can't expect him to win.  We had a pretty fair number of baserunners since we drew a few walks, but we couldn't move them over at all.  Just pathetic. 

I don't blame Gardy for getting kicked out.  Although he was right, that ball hit Kubel's foot. 

Does anyone know what the Twins can do to make a playoff push here right around the halfway point, or are we just a .500 team?  I'm beginning to think its the latter.
