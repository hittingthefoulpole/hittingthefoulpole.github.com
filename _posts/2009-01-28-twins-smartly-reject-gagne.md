According to Joe C, the Twins have <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/01/28/twins-halt-talks-with-gagne/">cut off their talks with Gagne</a>.

This is excellent news. He was worth -$4.6M last year. That's negative dollars. He hasn't been worth more than he's been paid since 2004. This is absolutely <em>not</em> the kind of pitcher you want to sign in free agency for any amount of money, much less "market value," which is invariably higher than actual value.

I'm not terrified of the bullpen this year -- I'd like an addition to replace Neshek, who really would have helped in the second half last year and probably gotten us into the playoffs, but it's absolutely not worth panicking and signing someone like Gagne.

This is a great non-move. Let someone else make a mistake on this disaster of a former-pitcher. It has <em>nothing</em> to do with being cheap.
