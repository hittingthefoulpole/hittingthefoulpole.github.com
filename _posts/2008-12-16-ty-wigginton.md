As everyone knows, the Astros non-tendered third baseman <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/w/wiggity01.shtml">Ty WIgginton </a>at Friday's deadline. LEN3 <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2008/12/14/pursuing-wigginton-makes-sense/">wrote </a>a piece about it over the weekend.  Despite his name being similar to Ty Willingham, I think the Twins should go after him.  He has the ability to hit for power, and play a competent third base.  Last year at age 30, he had an OPS+ of 128, that is very good.  His hitting line was .285/.350/.526, also excellent.  Apparently the Twins have been a fan of Wigginton since his days in Tampa, but have never been able to swing a deal to get him.  In 2008 he played 82 of the 111 games he played at third, with the rest coming in the OF.  For his career he has played in 747 games, 527 of them coming at third.  His career fielding percentage (not the greatest stat, I know, but bear with me) at third is .956, while not great it won't be a downgrade from any of our other 3B options. 

To summarize, he is a right handed, third baseman, with power.  What's not to like?  Well, probably the price tag.  Odds are he will get Casey Blake type money (how pathetic is that statement out of context?), something the Twins have shown they are not willing to do.  If we can somehow convince Wigginton to come to Minnesota on a 2 year, 14-15 mil deal, I'd say we do it.  The only thing we lose is money, which sucks, but we don't have to give up draft picks or prospects, which are more valuable to the Twins than money.  As of right now, I'd say he is our best outside option at third.  The cost for Beltre, Atkins, etc. will be way too high.  While Buscher and Harris would make for a fine platoon, I can see Gardy botching the platoon and going with the "hot hand" which you aren't supposed to do in a true platoon.  Brian Buscher should not be allowed to hit against lefties, its as simple as that.  I have a feeling lots of teams are interested in Wigginton, which is why the Twins should be going after him early and often.  Thoughts?

Update:  Word is Furcal has signed with the Braves.  So what do they do with the fine, young shortstop they already have?  Move one of Furcal/Escobar to second?  Or trade Escobar to the Twins for pennies on the dollar?  I would take him in a trade for pitcher.  A pitcher not named Slowey.  With the braves losing Smoltz, and losing out on the Peavy sweepstakes, they might need an established Major League starter, would anyone be opposed to throwing them one of Blackburn/Perkins for Yunel Escobar?  I know Gardy has named Punto our SS, but this team should take any left side infield upgrade it can get.  For the record I have heard no rumors saying that a)the Brave are looking to move Escobar, or b) the Twins have asked about him.  Its all speculation, which is all we can do during hot stove season.
