Well Joe Mauer is getting an MRI, or MRA or some such thing, on his back and stomach area to determine why he hasn't full recovered from offseason kidney surgery.  I wasn't worried about Mauer at all, until.  Maybe its because the keeper deadline in my fantasy baseball league was last week and Mauer is one of my keepers. 

Joe has always been a slow starter.  Which should come as no surprise, my guess is the wear and tear a major league catcher (who played 146 games and set a career high in plate appearance) takes during the season causes him to need a little more recovery time.  I also don't want to run around saying the sky is falling just because Mauer his "discomfort".  It wasn't even described as pain.  Hopefully the MRI comes back negative (or positive depending on how you look at it).  I think the most difficult part of all of this is not knowing what is wrong with him.  If we knew what the problem is, we would know how to treat it, and get Joe back on the field quicker.  Everyone on the Internet seems to be putting together lineups in case Mauer has to miss the start of the season.  I do not want to do that.  I still believe Joe won't miss any time, I also refuse to believe he is "injury-prone".  He isn't.
