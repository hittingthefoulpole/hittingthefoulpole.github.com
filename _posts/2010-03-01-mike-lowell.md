Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2010/02/28/08_cinderellas_hope_the_shoe_fits_better_this_time/?page=full">suggests</a>that the Red Sox somehow move <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=527&amp;position=3B">Mike Lowell </a>to the Twins.  Even if the Sox pick up the lion's share of the $12 million Lowell is owed for 2010, I don't see this happening. 

One of our top prospects, Danny Valencia, plays third, so why should we give up prospect to get Lowell for part of a season?  If our production from whoever plays third this year is Punto-esque (which is possible since Punto will likely be getting a lot of starts at the hot corner), wouldn't you rather they give Valencia a chance than trade for Lowell?  I like Mike Lowell, but I don't think its the right move. I think the rest of our lineup is good enough where we can afford to have a black hole at the bottom of the order.  It would be nice if Punto (or Harris) could give us something close to league average numbers, but I'm not holding my breath. 

Not really a whole lot to discuss on this topic, but I thought I'd point it out as we gear up for the season and I shake off the blogging rust.
