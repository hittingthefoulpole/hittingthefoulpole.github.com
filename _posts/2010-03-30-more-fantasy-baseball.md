I had another fantasy baseball draft this evening.  It is a keeper league in its fourth year, and this year my keepers were: Mauer, Tulowitzki, Longoria, Ellsbury, and Halladay.  I think that is a solid core, I get third, short, and catcher covered, which are pretty shallow.  For our categories we use R, RBI, HR, SB, OBP, SLG, W, SV, ERA, WHIP, K, QS.  I got steals covered with Ellsbury, Mauer does well in all of those categories (except SB), and Longoria &amp; Tulo aren't too shabby either.  So, since I finished 3rd last year I had the third to last pick in the first round (6th round after keepers).
<ul>
	<li>Kendry Morales, 1B LAA (70th)</li>
	<li>Aaron Hill, 2B TOR (75th)</li>
	<li>Jonathan Papelbon, RP BOS (94th)</li>
	<li>Manny Ramierz, OF LAD (99th)</li>
	<li>AJ Burnett, SP NYY  (118th)</li>
	<li>Kevin Slowey, SP MIN (123rd)</li>
	<li>Jason Kubel, OF MIN (142nd)</li>
	<li>Yunel Escobar, SS ATL (147th)</li>
	<li>Nolan Reimold, OF BAL (166th)</li>
	<li>Wade Davis, SP TB (171st)</li>
	<li>David Aardsma, RP SEA (190th)</li>
	<li>Dexter Fowler, OF COL (195th)</li>
	<li>Scott Feldman, SP TEX (214th)</li>
</ul>
I really like my offense.  Good balance of power, and OBP.  I could use a little more speed, so I can always insert Fowler into my lineup if someone doesn't perform/gets hurt. I picked up Escobar because he is a solid SS who I can always trade if someone else loses their SS, or I can use him if Tulo gets hurt.  I'm kind of surprised that Kubel, who was top 10 in AL OPS last year, fell to me that late.  I'm excited about Wade Davis, well the front office of the Rays is excited about him but that means I should be too. Right? Scott Feldman was a 17 game winner last year, so taking him with the last pick isn't a terrible idea. Even if he regresses a little he should still be solid.  If anyone made it to the end of this post, please let me know what you think of my team.
