This morning FunBobby alerted me to <a href="http://firegardy.com/2009/01/29/mijares-freaks-out-and-further-bullpen-analysis/">the Mijares situation</a>, and it was the first I'd heard of it. My initial reaction was to take a bit of  a wait-and-see approach before jumping to any conclusions about what it means:
<blockquote>I’m worried about this news about Mijares, but I don’t think the Dominican league is all that important and I don’t want to jump to conclusions. It’s possible that he had a disagreement with the manager, who may have wanted to increase/decrease his role against his will, and he didn’t want to endanger his actual major league career for the sake of his Dominican team. It’s also possible that he had a Silva-walking-off-the-mound moment and will get his head straight again. Again, no need to panic, but I certainly hope he talks to the Twins about this and gets everything straightened out.</blockquote>
Given that there's now an <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/01/30/a-closer-look-at-the-mijares-situation/">update on the situation</a>, now might be time for a little bit of further analysis here. Essentially what happened is that Mijares was looking great, then in a brief period of days he alternated between good and bad games with little rest in between, and in his second bad game he faced 4 batters without recording an out (obviously terrible) and ended up blowing a 3-0 lead and losing the game.
<blockquote>From there, the details are fuzzy. Depends on who you talk to, Twins officials say. But Mijares had a feud with Aragua manager Buddy Bailey, a no-nonsense skipper who has butted heads with players in the past.</blockquote>
A no-nonsense skipper who has butted heads with players in the past? It sure doesn't sound like our friend Gardy, who's an emotional player's manager and likes to be everyone's friend. So I don't know if Mijares' inability to get along with this no-nonsense jerk of a coach named Buddy Bailey who happens to have <em>no connection</em> whatsoever to the Twins really indicates that we're going to have a problem with his attitude. This sounds like a disagreement that could have been resolved by a little humility from the manager and a willingness to talk to the player. Since Bailey doesn't have to deal with Mijares for a whole season (or more), he doesn't need to make that investment in a young player.

That said, however, Gardy does have some quirks that effect his ability to show humility and willingness to get over issues with players. He seems to particularly hate players who have the poisonous combination of youth and talent; if you have just one of them, he likes you okay ... but if you have neither, you're his new best friend. Rondell White? Garrett Jones? Lew Ford? Luis Rodriguez? Jason Tyner? Nick Punto? These are names that bring a little bit of bile to the back of my throat, but that Gardy has in the past written into the lineup like it's his favoriate pastime. Since Mijares is young and talented, Gardy may want to give him the Alexi Casilla treatment -- ie, jerk him around and sit his ass on the bench until he gets sent down, and who cares if that hurts the team I'm making a point!

If this event is an indication of Mijares' general attitude, that treatment from Gardy will probably result in the same outcome, which is what we don't want.

Want a bit of hope?
<blockquote>Mijares, 24, has struggled with his weight in the past.</blockquote>
Ooh, goody. Gardy <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/sports/images/Carlos%20Silva.jpg">loves</a> him a <a href="http://images.publicradio.org/content/2008/03/31/20080331_80452845_33.jpg">fat</a> <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/images/baseball/mlb/players/5847.jpg">Mexican</a>*! So maybe we're safe after all.

<em>By "Mexican" I mean "Hispanic," but "fat Hispanic guy" doesn't have that same poetic feel to it. Thanks for your understanding, everyone.</em>

Gardy hasn't reacted to this yet, so I'll get back with something when/if he ever does. But Bill Smith is doing what he can to lose his "Wild" prefix, and is spewing some boilerplate for public consumption.
<blockquote>“We’re happy he pitched winter ball; he had a good regular season,” Twins General Manager Bill Smith said.</blockquote>
Really Bill? You mean you didn't want him to sit on his ass eating burritos all winter? And yes, he had a good regular season. Thank you. An 0.87 ERA is, you know, good.
<blockquote>As for walking out on the Aragua team, Smith said, “I’m not sure [Mijares] handled it as well as anyone would have liked.”</blockquote>
Ah. Yes, thanks. Obviously, walking out on the team and then getting thrown off it isn't the <em>best</em> way to handle yourself. It's a good thing we have a GM to clear this stuff up for us.

Then Smith was asked if Mijares is a lock to make the Twins’ Opening Day roster.
<blockquote>“No he’s not,” he said. “If he comes to camp thinking he’s a lock for our bullpen, he’ll probably be in [Class AAA] Rochester after our first cuts. If he pitches the way he did in September, he has a good chance of making our club.”</blockquote>
You mean a young player with 10 games of major league experience <em>isn't</em> guaranteed a spot on the roster? Weird, I thought 10 good games was all you needed to get into the Hall of Fame. What, it was years? 10 good years? Oh, never mind then.

But I certainly hope that Mijares goes down with the "first cuts" just because of an incident in Venezuela involving the bruised ego of some nobody of a manager, name of Buddy Bailey. Why the shit should we care about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Bailey">Buddy Bailey</a>?

Everybody just relax and evaluate him based on his ability to get people out, and his ability to bounce back from a bad outing <em>under the tutelage of Gardy and Anderson</em>. Not based on the opinion of Buddy Bailey.
