Well it's official, the Twins <a href="http://www.startribune.com/blogs/Around_the_majors.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUqCP:iUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr">signed</a> Jim Thome.  The deal is reported to be for $1.5 million, with up to $750K in incentives.  I'm assuming these are plate appearance incentives.  The price tag on this deal seems too good to pass up, so I'm OK with it.

I have two fears that arose with this signing.  The first is that we won't pursue any middle infield candidates.  The second is that Jim Thome will stunt the development of Delmon Young.  While Thome has better numbers against righties than Young does, Delmon is still very raw.  Maybe Thome will help him develop as a slugger.  Ideally, the Twins will acquire either Lopez or Hudson in the coming weeks, and Thome will be used primarily off the bench and occasionally as the DH depending on the matchup. If we are facing a pitcher who Thome has historically crushed, then by all means start him.

So, let's hope that Bill Smith isn't done making moves, but I am not overly optimistic.
