<a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3265123&amp;name=olney_buster">Buster Olney talked to Michael Cuddyer</a>, and got this out of him via email:
<blockquote>E-mailed the Twins' <strong>Michael Cuddyer</strong> and asked him about his first impressions of <strong>Delmon Young</strong>, and about landing his own long-term extension. Young, Cuddyer wrote in response, "has impressed. We all know how much talent he has and how good he is going to be, but what has impressed me the most is the way he has been carrying himself. He is really excited to be here, excited to learn, excited to be a part of our organization and a part of the way we do things. He has been nothing but eager to soak up the knowledge of Rod Carew, Tony Oliva, and I am sure Harmon Killebrew once he arrives. So in response to what has jumped out at me is not what has transpired on the field but what he has brought with him off the field. I think the middle of our lineup could, and entire lineup in fact, could really surprise a lot of people. For some reason a lot of people have forgotten about the accolades this team won two years ago and two of those three, obviously excluding the Cy Young, are still here. Add Delmon in there, Brendan Harris as well and we can potentially be pretty impressive. All of course on paper!"</blockquote>
Obviously we've been high on Delmon the whole time he's been a Twin, and none of this is especially new, given the reports that have been coming out of the organization.

But it's promising to hear that Cuddyer agrees, and is just as excited about Delmon as we are. Additionally, he seems to be jumping on my "Twins offense will be the surprise of the year" bandwagon. (There's still plenty of room, by the way.) I like it, Mike. Keep up the good work. Of course, he's missing the biggest key to the successful offense: the emergence of Kubel.
