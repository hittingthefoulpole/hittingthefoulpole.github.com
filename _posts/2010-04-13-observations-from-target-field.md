I have a ton of pictures from the game yesterday and will give them their own post sometime tonight.  Here are some thoughts on the new park
<ul>
	<li>It is awesome.  Everything you have read/heard is true. Sightlines are great.</li>
	<li>I saw Frank Viola and Jack Morris wandering around.</li>
	<li>I rode in an elevator with Larry Fitzgerald, he is a large man.</li>
	<li>The Target mascot, bullseye, was sitting in a nearby section.  He literally had the best seat in the park.</li>
</ul>
I didn't get a chance to do much wandering.  This was on purpose because I figure everyone else will be doing the same, and I know I will be back soon.  I'll wait for everyone else to get it out of their system, before I take time to wander aimlessly.

Lost (to some) in the chaos of the "opener", was that the Twins won and looked damn good doing so.  I was excited to have Pavano start because I didn't think he would be affected by the hoopla surrounding the game.  He didn't "grow up" as a Twin, so this probably wasn't as big a deal to him as it would have been to Baker or Slowey.  The offense continues to click, and Jon Rauch looks good enough as the closer.  All these things can be qualified with "for now"

I'll post again with some pictures.  I took about 70 and was too tired last night to sift through them all, and pick the ones I wanted to upload.  So stay tuned for that, and leave your thoughts on Target Field or the game in general in the comments.
