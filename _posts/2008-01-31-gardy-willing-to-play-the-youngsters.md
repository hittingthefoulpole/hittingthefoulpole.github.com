Gardenhire has long disliked young players, preferring low quality veterans over promising youngsters. Is it <em>possible</em> that he's <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080130&amp;content_id=2359821&amp;vkey=news_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min">changing is mind</a> as the team gets even younger than usual?
<blockquote> "There are some veterans out there coming off injuries and so forth that we could take a look at, but we've tried that route," Gardenhire said. "I would rather take my shot with some of these young guys than some of the guys coming off injuries.

"We really haven't seen people out there that are better than our young guys. We've got a young lineup and some young pitchers and there is no sense that they can't go together. We have to give some of those young guys a chance, and they can help us."</blockquote>
Those sound like the words of someone who realizes we have a young team, and has learned from the mistakes of the recent past (namely, ROrtiz and Ponson). It certainly doesn't sound like Gardy. I still expect him to jerk the pitchers around, inexplicably skip starts, and completely mismanage the rotation, but it might be more difficult for him this year. He no longer has an ace, so he can't say "it all depends on what Johan wants," and he no longer has a pathetic veteran who loses all his confidence if any of his starts are skipped.

If Wild Bill doesn't sign any crappy veterans to waste space in the rotation, I'll be satisfied.
