That is more like it.

Even though its just one win, I think this was a huge statement game.  The Twins were downright dominated on Monday when they faced King Felix, and by the looks of things early, it appeared as if Bedard was more of the same.  Then they started racking up hits, and got to the soft underbelly of the Mariners bullpen.

Limiting Bedard to only five innings was huge.  I'm not sure if Seattle was being careful and pulled him early, or if they didn't think he had enough to get any more outs, but either way I'm thankful he only lasted five.  

The two offensive stars of the game were Span and Cuddyer.  Despite Cuddyer's propensity to strike out, he had some good at bats.  Span was 3-5, which is a great follow up to his 2 walk performance last night.  I really think he is going to have a good year.  He might not hit 290, but with his defense (at a corner OF position, no less) and ability to get on base, there is no reason he should not be playing everyday.

I was at the game last night, and after the Mariners scored their fifth run, to go up 5-3, people started leaving.  My friend questioned this.  Why leave with half an inning left.  You already invested three hours, why not stay a little bit longer, two runs isnt' much.  I agreed.  And during the Seattle pitching change, that same friend ran out to use the bathroom and noticed people crowded in the concourse watching the game on the closed circuit TVs.  Unbelievable.

Anyway, on to the ninth inning we go.  Seattle's closer, Brandon Marrow looks as if he will breeze through the ninth and put the Twins in an 0-2 hole to start the season.  Wrong-0!  Three consecutive walks, (along with some excellent, if obvious, managing by Gardy) Seattle then brought in Batista (who is terrible) to pitch to Span.  Span chopped one to third and it was too high for Beltre to handle.  Everybody safe.  5-4.  The Casilla finished the job by lacing one back up the middle.  Game over.

I was really impressed with how the Twins handled themselves at the plate.  They got down early, much like monday, against a good pitcher.  This time they didn't go into their shells.  They kept battling, scraped together 3 runs in the fifth.  Once they realized Morrow couldn't throw a strike, they didn't try to hit bad pitches, like they sometimes do.  Just try to get on base.  It would have sucked to start the season 0-2, but I think the most important part of this win is that we came back from 4-0, and had solid performance out of the middle relievers.   It also showed how important having good bench players is.  Kubel and Buscher both had great at bats.

Anyway, game two is in the books, now we get to see what our old friend Carlos Silva is up to.
