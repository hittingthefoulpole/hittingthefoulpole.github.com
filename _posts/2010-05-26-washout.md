Well, that wasn't very much fun.  But this is what we signed up for, right? Baseball in the elements.  MLB raincheck policy is kind of a bummer, but logistically, this was the only move they could make.  It would have been near impossible to get everyone in for the last 4 innings tomorrow afternoon, then out in time for the 6pm ticket holders.  There is also apparently some huge event today at Target Center that is supposed to draw 20 thousand people.   It is unfortunate that this had to happen during a game where ticket prices were probably at their highest, but as Forrest Gump said "Shit happens".

Duensing is scheduled to being the sixth at 4pm tonight, and hopefully the bats come alive and the Twins can pull out two victories today.
