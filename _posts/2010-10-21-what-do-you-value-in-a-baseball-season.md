If you blinked, you may have missed the Twins' annual postseason beatdown at the hands of the Yankees. It sure happened in a hurry.

What might be the problem? According to [this totally unscientific and probably biased poll](http://poll4.me/poll/4cb201ef03e5bf4e4200001f/), people think the two biggest factors are that they can't beat the Yankees, or that Gardy is the problem. It seems to me that if one of those is a problem, then they both are -- the only common threads between the Twins/Yankees at the beginning of the current streak of dominance and the Twins/Yankees today are the cities where the teams play (but not the stadiums), Gardy, and perhaps the amused attitude the media takes to the lovable small market peons that have the gall to even show up to the postseason.

If Gardy is the problem, then it's going to be a tough one to fix. Overall, Gardy is a good manager; probably one of the best in the game right now, especially over the course of the full season. He seems to understand the ebbs and flows of the season, and that today isn't necessarily as important as all the tomorrows -- for example, he pulled Kevin Slowey after seven no-hit innings, because the chance at a no-hitter on that day wasn't as important as Slowey's health for the rest of the season and for the rest of Slowey's career. This is the sort of attitude and behavior that will keep the clubhouse loose even when things are going badly, and will engender a feeling of trust among the players. That may well be the secret to Gardy's success as a manager.

However, he leaves a lot to be desired from an in-game, tactical perspective. Part of that is certainly that he's willing to sacrifice today to protect tomorrow. He won't bring in the closer for a 5-out save, because he wants the closer available tomorrow. He won't push back a struggling starter's spot in the rotation because he doesn't want to hurt his confidence. He'll leave a slumping hitter at the plate despite the platoon disadvantage. Over the course of the season, you'd think these tactical "mistakes" would add up; but it seems to me that Gardy's record suggests that either they don't add up to all that much, that it all pretty much evens out, or that the benefits of his approach outweigh the negatives.

Unfortunately, that approach doesn't apply nearly as well in the postseason. Once the playoffs start, tomorrow matters a whole lot less than today -- for one thing, there are fewer tomorrows; and perhaps more importantly, without today, there may not be any tomorrows at all. Each moment in the playoffs is magnified -- this is what the TBS and Fox announcers have repeated from their script hundreds of times so far in these playoffs. So the postseason minimizes Gardy's positive contributions, and maximizes the effects of his weaknesses. It's no wonder, then, that Gardy's teams have repeatedly struggled in the playoffs.

Now, I don't believe this explains why the Twins have lost 12 consecutive playoff games, or 9 straight to the Yankees. I do, however, see how it would explain why the Twins would lose each of these playoff series (especially combined with the fact that they were the lesser team in each case); it's not a far step from there, for small sample size flukes to turn four straight playoff series losses into four straight playoff series sweeps. It sucks, and it hurts every time -- each year, I've managed to convince myself that this time, somehow, it'll be different -- but what can you do about it?

Is firing Gardenhire an option? The Twins don't consider it to be one -- Bill Smith said extending Gardy's contract was "a no brainer" after the season ended -- and I tend to agree. Would the Twins have dominated the AL Central this decade with a different manager at the helm? Maybe, and maybe not. Would they have fared better in the playoffs, when or if they made it? Maybe, and maybe not. It's not really a fair question, nor is it even possible to answer.

Posnanski has talked in the past about following a team whose philosophy about the game differs from your own. The example he typically gives is that a statistically-minded fan, who believes that there's more to understanding the game than was etched in stone by the cigar-chomping fathers of baseball, can struggle to deal with rooting for a team that openly and proudly rejects progress; that when you as a fan believe that OBP is an important offensive statistic and the team you follow proudly runs out a lineup of sub-.300 OBP "hitters," it gets frustrating. It's a rough feeling.

I've had that feeling about the Twins, at times. They value a certain sort of player, a slap-hitting middle infielder with more hustle than talent, a guy who hits .300/.300/.300 (bats .300 but draws no walks and hits nothing but singles); meanwhile, I value a different sort of player, who may not have a .300 batting average but who will draw walks and take multiple bases when he gets a hit. They value a certain sort of pitcher, a strike-throwing machine who can hit his spots and minimize walks; I value a different sort of pitcher, who has movement on his pitches or who throws harder, and can generate strikeouts. The Twins and I have disagreed as to the source of their success: they have always believed it was due to those strike-throwers having a solid defense behind them, and I've always pointed out that when the team had an ERA among the league leaders, the pitching staff was also among the league leaders in strikeouts, and strikeout-to-walk ratio.

In this case, though, we're not talking about whether you agree with the team's philosophy on what makes a good baseball player, or even what wins games. This is a larger question, one that even more certainly has no "true," or "correct" answer. That question is: **What do you value in a baseball season?**

Seems simple, right? But I think you'll find that the answer is a bit more difficult to put your finger on than you might think. Do you value championships, above all else? Many fans would like to think that they do, but if that were true, they'd either be Yankee fans or perpetually unhappy -- there just aren't that many championships. Do you value postseason success; not necessarily winning championships, but competing strongly for them and getting close? That gives a little more leeway, but still, you're only enjoying baseball when your team is among the best in the league. Perhaps you enjoy the business side of baseball, wondering what you'd do differently if you were the GM -- what moves would you do differently, what sort of team would you build from this foundation? Or the tactical aspect of individual games -- if you were the manager, would you bring in that reliever now, or see if the starter can get a couple more guys? Like I said, there's no right answer, and I would think that most fans would answer in the affirmative to multiple of these examples.

Maybe, though, you value something else about a baseball season. Maybe you value the daily grind, getting to the ballpark or to your favored chair in front of the television, at the same time every day, to watch the games unfold in front of you. Maybe you enjoy watching the young players move up through the system, until they finally join the big club and you can see how they fit in and wonder what it's like in the clubhouse. Maybe you like the ups and downs of a long season -- the downs can feel so bad, and so dark, and you can wonder how this team could ever win a game ... but that only makes the ups seem so much brighter, that your team is on top of the world and cannot be stopped, that the summer is flying by in a blur of bats cracking, balls flying, brilliant moments, sunsets, and cheers. That is, maybe you value the season as a whole, moreso than any individual game, than any particular move, than how big is the trophy that the team gets at the end of it.

And by sticking with Gardy, I think that's what the Twins are saying that they value. It's not how you feel after the last game of the season; rather, it's how you felt through _all_ the games.

Maybe mastering the long season prevents Gardy from performing in a short series where individual games mean everything. Maybe he just needs to learn a different way to manage, a different way to inspire the players, a different perspective that only comes into focus in the heat of the postseason. Maybe the playoffs are a complete crapshoot, and all this talk that Gardy "can't win" in the playoffs will dissolve like so much smoke in the wind once the Twins finally stop drawing the short straw once they get there.

Who knows? Myself, I value the 162 games that come first, considerably more than the 3 games that came last. And for once, the Twins seem to agree. It's a strange feeling, to agree philosophically with your team. A good feeling.

What do you value in a baseball season?
