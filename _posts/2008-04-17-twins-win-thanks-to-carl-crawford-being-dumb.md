When i saw Carl Crawford slide to catch that ball in foul territory last night I shouted "idiot!", despite the fact that I was alone in my home.  That was a very boneheaded move. It would be one thing to catch it standing up (well maybe not for Crawford because the throws like a girl), but to make a circus catch with one out in the 8th of a tied game with the go ahead runner (with speed) on third? careless.  Did he think there were two outs? Possibly, that seems to happen more and more with kids these days.  I read in the paper this morning that he was just focused on making the out, not determining fair or foul.  Well, that is a lame excuse, but lets run with it. Shouldn't the third baseman or shortstop  have been yelling at him to let it drop? Maybe they were and he couldn't hear them over the 10 people who showed up to watch baseball inside on the first truly nice day of spring. As I saw Crawford track that ball down I kept saying to myself (again, aloud) "he's going to let it drop...he's got to let it drop...he's going to catch it! Idiot!"

On to the actual game. Livan looked like the Livan of old. Walks, homers, slow.  That 2 run homer he gave up to Riggans. Man. There was no way he COULDN'T homer on that pitch. It was good to see the team hit the ball well. 11 hits. And we do OK with RISP.  Mauer seems to have broken out of his slump, hitting the ball well the last two games. He is now back to 300.  Gomez looked ok, he is at least exciting to watch.  I'm glad to see Kubel as a fixture in the lineup. Its a shame it took an injury to one of our better players to force Gardy into playing... another one of our better players. Idiot!

I wonder how long it will take me to not be nervous when a member of our bulpen steps in I hope Reyes gets paid overtime because he got 4 guys out, compared to his usual one or none. Rincon's fastball looked pretty good, and he got the win. Nathan was, as always, good. I pretty much expect him to give up one baserunner.

Another question, why do people run on Mauer? The two putouts he had were very pretty. I would have loved to see him toss out Bartlett in the ninth, but as they say, 2 out of 3 aint' bad. 

Boof is going tonight against someone I have never heard of for Tampa. This weekend is the Indians, who looked terrible last night as CC got shelled. We need to pounce on them.

Did anyone hear Scott Erickson in the booth today. When he and his wife were in there Dick said something along the lines of "Scott, you and your wife are here to talk about a special project" So i'm thinking, great Scott is going to talk about some charity. No. It was a lame movie called "A Plumm Summer" which Scott is exec producing. When asked what he did every day as a produced Scott replied "golf, fly fishing, hang out" Tough life, dude.
