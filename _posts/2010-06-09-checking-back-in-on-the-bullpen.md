A little over a month ago I wrote a <a href="http://hittingthefoulpole.com/2010/04/28/twins-bullpen-update/">post</a> highlighting (or lowlighting) the Twins bullpen through the first month of the season.  I think its time to take another look at the unit some said would cost the Twins the division.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1475&amp;position=P">Jon Rauch</a>

23 ip, 6.65 k/9, 1.17 BB/9, .334 BABIP, 2.74 ERA

Rauch has racked up 15 saves, and converted all but two of them. He hasn't had overpowering stuff, as his K/9 is pretty low, probably about half what Nathan's was at his best.  But he is getting the job done.  For now.  I don't think he has done anything to make Gardenhire remove him from the job, but we should keep a close eye on him.  Rauch seems like the kind of pitcher who falls apart quickly.  We don't get one red flag at a time, they will come in bunches.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=2061&amp;position=P">Matt Geurrier</a>

48ip, 6.38 K/0, 2.81 BB/9, .293 BABIP, 3.75 ERA

Guerrier's ERA comes in slightly below is FIP, and his BABIP is in line with league average, so we shouldn't see any huge blowups (or tremendous improvements) the rest of the season.  Like Rauch, his strikeout numbers are underwhelming for a late inning reliever, but he gets the job one.  He had a very good April (.73 ERA in 12.1 innings) and a much more pedestrian May (2.45 ERA in 11 innings) but that is the kind of pitcher he is.  I value consistency in relief pitchers (as long as they are consistently good).

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4064&amp;position=P">Brian Duensing</a>

23.2 IP, 5.32K/9, 2.28 BB/9, .221 BABIP, 1.52 ERA

Duensings FIP is almost 2 runs higher than his ERA, and his BABIP is very low, so I expect him to regress to the mean at some point.  He has been a very nice surprise as a multi inning reliever, and I hope he can keep it up.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4140&amp;position=P">Jose Mijares</a>

11.2 IP, 6.17 K/9, 3.38  BB/9, .306 BABIP, 2.31 ERA

After a disastrous start to the season, followed by a stay on the DL, Mijares has turned things around a little.  His ERA is still way out of line compare to his FIP, and he showed last night he is still capable of melting down even in low leverage situation. I don't think I'll every really trust him, but hopefully he bounced back from last night and returns to his May form.  A month in which he was pretty awesome

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4065&amp;position=P">Alex Burnett</a>

28.1 IP, 7.31 K/9, 3.49 BB/9 .288 BABIP, 2.54 ERA

Burnett has been the biggest surprise of the season thus far.  He leads all relievers in innings pitched, and strikeouts.  His FIP and ERA are pretty well aligned, and his BABIP isn't off the charts high or low.  Expect him to chug along and be a very useful reliever for the Twins for the rest of the season and beyond.

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=290&amp;position=P">Ron Mahay</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4817&amp;position=P">Jesse Crain</a>

Neither of these pitchers is very good.  I think we seriously need to consider replacing both of them in the near future.  That is all.
