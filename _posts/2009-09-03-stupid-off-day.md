I apologize for not having posted anything in a very long time.  I'm sure everyone missed me, but since college football is gearing up my attention has been focused on my Fighting Irish.  I will try to split my time accordingly between the the Twins and ND, they do  legally have joint custody of me.

The loss yesterday hurts, but remember we still have SEVEN games left against Detroit. 3 at home, 4 at Comerica.  It doesn't really bother me that we have to play in Detroit.  From what I recall we don't play unusually terrible there compared with say Cleveland or Chicago.  You won't see Gardy bitching about a stadium we travel to 10 times a year and blaming said stadium on all of our failures.  Cough (Ozzie) Cough.  Excuse me.  We just need to keep winning, and getting quality starts from the back end of the rotation the rest of the season.  If Baker-Pavano-Blackburn-Manship-Duensing can pitch like they did the most recent time though the rotation for the entire month we will be in good shape.  Joe Nathan is going to spectacularly blow saves too often down the stretch. He is just too good. I'm going to chalk yesterday up to a bad day.  Nothing more.

The Tigers play the Indians at home this afternoon.  I for one will be following on gamecast and cheering on the Tribe.
