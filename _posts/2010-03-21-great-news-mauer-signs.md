The Twins have agreed to terms with starting catcher Joe Mauer. The deal is reportedly 8 years, $184 million with a full no trade clause.   A press conference is scheduled for Monday night at the Twins complex in Ft. Myers. This is great news people.  The average annual value is $23 million, a hair more than Texiera is making in New York.  If there was a hometown discount, there wasn't much of one.  I would imagine he would be getting $25ish from the New York/Boston team. 8 years is a long time, but it will cover Mauer's age 28-35 seasons which are his prime years.

What does everyone else think?  We will break it down further once more details come out at the press conference tomorrow.
