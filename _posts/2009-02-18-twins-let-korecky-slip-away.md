Another reason to get angry.

<a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/02/18/korecky-to-arizona/">Bobby Korecky is gone</a>. For nothing. He was selected off waivers by the Diamondbacks, which "conveniently" opens up a space on the 40 man roster for Luis Ayala.

I suppose Korecky was probably last on the list of relievers on the bubble (Bonser, Humber, Breslow, Mijares, Korecky), but I don't see any reason to just throw him away in favor of a proven <em>bad</em>Â pitcher like Ayala, who will cost three times as much.

Korecky didn't actually do all that well in the majors last season, and was worth -0.1 wins. Meanwhile, Ayala was worth +0.1 despite his struggles. And Ayala is projected to have a better FIP than Korecky in 2009.

But I've always said that doing nothing is better than doing something stupid. I'm not really happy about this move. It doesn't seem like it helps the team at all, and we lose a valuable asset (an arm that can get outs) without getting anything in return. That's the worst kind of move.

Can anyone think of a reason this is an acceptable move?
