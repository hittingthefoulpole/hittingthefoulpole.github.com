Lets hit on a few things that have been happening with the Twins and around the league these past few days:
<ul>
	<li>Derek Lowe signs with the Braves for four years, $60 mil.  <strong>Without </strong>a no-trade clause.  That isn't a terrible signing, considering he is a Boras client.   Doesn't Boras almost always get no trade clauses, and opt out clauses for his clients?  I'd say the Braves won this one.</li>
	<li>The Braves also signed Japanese pitcher Kenshin Kawakami for 3 years, 23 mil.  He projects to be a starter.  The Braves did a good job this week rebuilding their starting rotation.</li>
	<li>Michael Young asked the Rangers to trade him because he doesn't want to switch positions.  The Twins popped up as a potential suitor, but I hope Smith and co. respond with an emphatic "No Thanks".  Young is bad defensively at short,despite "winning" a gold glove. (I think the term "given" is better than "won" when referring to a gold glove).  His OPS, along with almost all his other offensive numbers, have declined steadily in each of the last 4 years.  He might be the single most overrated player in the AL.</li>
	<li>Manny and Dunn still are unemployed.  Dunn will probably sign a one year contract somewhere in the hopes of signing a big money, multiyear contract after the 09 season.  Manny will probably wait too long, and come out with a contract that is only slightly better than the money he would have earned had he stayed in Boston. We will all laugh at this.</li>
	<li>Jermaine Dye's name is still floating around, but nobody seems willing to trade for him.  The Angels are the latest to express no interest.</li>
	<li>Mark Prior has been given another chance.  Signing a one year, minor league deal with the Padres.  Who is second guessing the drafting of Mauer now? That's what I thought.</li>
	<li>The Twins spent another week sitting on their hands.  As we discussed earlier, this is probably a good thing as prices on free agents are dropping faster than shares of Citigroup.</li>
	<li>Bert Blyleven was again denied admission to the baseball hall of fame.  I want him to make it to the hall, but I don't think he should get upset over what a few hundred sports writers think of him.  Baseball people (GMs, owners, players) know he was great, fans know he was great, and he has a few rings.  Everything else is out of his control.  I was watching the Mike and Mike radio show before work on Tuesday, and he sounded very frustrated.  Hopefully they get it right next year, but if not he shouldn't let it bother him.  Easier said than done I'm sure.</li>
	<li>Anything else I missed? </li>
</ul>
