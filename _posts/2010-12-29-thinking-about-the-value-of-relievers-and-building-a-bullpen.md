There's been a lot of talk about bullpens, and how to build them. The general consensus seems to be that signing relief pitchers to expensive multi-year contracts is a bad idea: [Dave Cameron points out that the setup men who have signed 3+ year deals since 2006 have combined for +0.1 WAR](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/relievers-are-not-worth-multi-year-deals/), which is not what their teams wanted when they signed them.

And so, while the loss of Jesse Crain to the White Sox and Matt Guerrier to the Dodgers has gutted the Twins' bullpen and generated much trepidation among fans, both of them got three year deals and it was probably wise for the Twins not to match their salary offers even if they could have afforded it.

But if you're not acquiring relievers on the free agent market once they've demonstrated success at the major league level, where do they come from? I would think the cheapest, highest-value way to go is to generate them internally, and the Twins have certainly tried that, rolling out Jeff Manship, Alex Burnett, Pat Neshek, Anthony Slama, Rob Delaney, and other home-grown relievers. Of course, none of them looked very good in 2010, and the Twins may not want to trust them as the core of the bullpen in 2011.

The only other options, then, are grasping at castaways from other teams, guys that other teams have tried before and didn't like what they saw -- that's how the Twins got Matt Guerrier, so it's possible to find good pitchers in this pool. But it's also where they got Randy Flores and myriad other nobodies; there's just as much uncertainty here as there is in the home-grown group, perhaps even more.

Finally, you can make trades to bolster your relief corps. That seems to be the direction the Twins are going, as they reject the high price tags on free agent relievers.

### Relievers the Twins have recently acquired:

- Chuck James, minor league deal. From the Braves. Had rotator cuff surgery in 2008.
- Paul Bargas, traded from the Rockies for Jose Morales.
- Brett Jacobson, traded from the Orioles for Hardy/Harris.
- Jim Hoey, traded from the Orioles for Hardy/Harris.
- Brian Fuentes, traded from the Angels for Loek Van Mil.
- Randy Flores, picked up off waivers.
- Matt Capps, traded from the Nationals for Wilson Ramos.
- Clay Condrey, minor league deal.
- Chris Province, traded from the Red Sox for Boof Bonser.
- Ron Mahay, traded from the Royals.
- Jon Rauch, traded from the Diamondbacks for Kevin Mulvey.

That's 8 relievers acquired in trade, 3 castaways picked up off waivers or on a minor league contract, and 0 free agents.

What strikes me is the disparity in the cost of these relievers, on the trade market. Rauch is a serviceable arm, and Kevin Mulvey ... isn't much to give up. Chris Province may be nobody, but Boof Bonser had absolutely no value by the time the Twins let him go. Brian Fuentes is a good pitcher, certainly has value in the late innings, and Loek Van Mil's shot at ever making it to the big leagues is a pretty tall order.

On the other cheek, though, are the guys who required legitimate players to acquire. Capps is overrated by his save totals and was only a half-season removed from a 5.80 ERA, and he netted top catching prospect Wilson Ramos. Paul Bargas is an interesting choice, but he's only 21 years old and in Single-A; the Twins gave up a pretty good backup catcher in Jose Morales. Jacobson/Hoey are giant question marks: Jacobson is 23 years old and still down in Single-A, Hoey has put up big strikeout numbers in the minors that didn't translate into the majors even before his arm exploded. And the Twins had to surrender above-average shortstop JJ Hardy in order to get them.

This analysis, however, has ignored the effect of money on trade valuations. The Twins took on Rauch's salary from the Diamondbacks, so they didn't have to give up much in terms of players. The same is true of Brian Fuentes, who was virtually free when it came to prospects because the Angels were looking to cut a couple of millions dollars off their books and the Twins were deafened by the sound of cash registers ringing in the first year of Target Field.

Meanwhile, the Twins were able to cut about $8M off their payroll by throwing Hardy & Harris to the winds, and that drastically reduced what they could expect in return. Still, Hardy is currently projected to be worth around $12M in 2011, so the Twins sent as much as $4M in surplus value to the Orioles -- that value will come back only if either Hoey or Jacobson turns into a solid bullpen option at some point, which is possible but unlikely.

Capps was in the middle of a $3.5M contract when the Twins traded for him, and the Nationals sent $0.5M along as part of the deal. So he probably cost the Twins between $1.5M and $2M, and with the focus on all those saves and desperation sinking in as Rauch struggled, that probably seemed like it was far less than he was worth. The illusion of a huge amount of surplus value is probably what helped drive the prospect-cost up, but even at the time there was no conceivable way for Capps to produce enough value in half a season as to be worth losing a valuable prospect like Wilson Ramos.

When I started this, I thought I'd conclude that the cost of relievers in the trade market was rising rapidly, to match the inflated cost of relievers on the free agent market. That doesn't seem to be the case, though. The Capps trade was a bad move, and while Hardy brought back an underwhelming haul that was because that was effectively a salary dump.* Beyond that, these trades have not been expensive in terms of players.

_* In the end, I think that's what bothers me most about the Hardy trade. In just a few short months, the Twins' attitude transformed from "sure, we'll take on Fuentes' salary ... did you know this money was printed on trees?" to "we can't afford any free agents, we can't afford to keep our own players, and we need to save money by dumping the guy we were all excited about last winter." The payroll ballooned quickly, but in the scheme of things it didn't take long for the Twins to return to the tepid, penny-pinching days of old. Trading for Hardy in the first place was representative of the expanding budget, and trading him away is representative of the wallet suddenly slamming shut._

With the departure of most of the bullpen this offseason, Bill Smith set his focus on rebuilding a relief corps. He's made a series of small moves to inject talented arms into the mix, putting the team in position to hope that at least a few of them pan out; that's really all you can do with relievers anyway, and Smith has wisely decided that it's better to give guaranteed dollars to players who can give you more predictable performance.
