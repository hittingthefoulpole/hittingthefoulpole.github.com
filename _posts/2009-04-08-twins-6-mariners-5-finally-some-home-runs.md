Homers by Morneau and Span were the most obvious evidence of the offense awakening in game 3, showing off the first power the Twins have found so far this year, lifting the team to a 2-1 record despite a rough night from Slowey -- the third consecutive sub-par start we've had to try to overcome. Given that a big strength of the team is supposed to be the starting pitching, this is a little worrying. But again, it's still early; I think they'll hit their stride.

This WPA graph from FanGraphs is evidence of a significantly more comfortable game than we've played so far this year, and hopefully we can enjoy plenty more games with graphs like this. Especially when the game trades back and forth in such exciting fashion. Absolutely nothing wrong with entertainment like this.

I want to point out Morneau's "double" in the 5th inning, when he drove in a run to tie the game. It was a hard grounder up the middle, that got through and went to center. It scored a run, sure, but the impressive part of the play was the Morneau managed to take second before the ball came back in from the outfield. Blyleven apparently* pointed out that Morneau saw that the CF was running to his left and would thus have to stop his momentum before throwing the ball back into the infield.

<em>* I say "apparently" because I had the game on mute, and my dad reported Bert's comments to me via Skype. (Which, by the way, is a great way to watch a ballgame when there's nobody you know within miles of you.</em>

However it happened, it was good. Because Morneau scored what turned out to be the winning run on the next play when Kubel doubled him home -- Morneau and his "speed" could not have scored from first. It was simply a great play by the Twins' MVP.

Despite my concerns about Slowey and all our starting pitching at this point, this was a good win and we've pushed ourselves into the above-.500-column, which is exactly where we want to be. Game 4 is at noon on Thursday, and hopefully we can push some runs across again and win the series.
