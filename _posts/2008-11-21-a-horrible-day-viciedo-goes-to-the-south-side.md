I don't like this at all.

A few days ago, <a href="http://firegardy.com/2008/11/10/offseaon-update/#comments">we were talking about the young Cuban third baseman, Dayan Viciedo</a>. Huge power bat. 19 years old. Apparently available for a cheap contract.

We wanted him. At the time, the numbers sounded like they'd be in the $10M for 4 years range, which is more than affordable, and considerably less than we'll probably end up giving to Casey Blake for Christmas. (Because for some reason we have to reward guys who used to be in our system, even if it doesn't help out our team.)

Well, now he's gone. For $11M for 4 years. And worse ... <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2008/11/white-sox-to-si.html">he went to the White Sox</a>. Their problems at third base weren't nearly as bad as ours ("How do we replace Joe Crede's ineffectiveness?" "Can Josh Fields' power at the plate overcome his weakness in the field?" as opposed to "Are we still a major league team without a left side of an infield?"), and now they've made a huge upgrade.

In 2008, they had The Cuban Missile, Alexei Ramirez. I like that guy, and he did really well for the White Sox. Well, take him, replace his prodigious speed with prodigious power, and now the White Sox have another infielder who's going to contend for rookie of the year. Again.

Letting Viciedo go to another team for such a low price is a mistake I can forgive. (Unless we end up signing Blake or Crede or Branyan for three times as much.) But letting Viciedo go to the hated White Sox is a colossal mistake that we're going to realize in the 80 ABs he's going to get against us this year, of which I'm assuming 10-25 will be home runs.

This is a horrible day.
