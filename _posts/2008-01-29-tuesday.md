One of the posters on LEN3's blog suggested that instead of trading Johan away we should trade for Eric Bedard.  He claimed that since the going rate was only an Adam Jones (not Pacman) type player. Great. Where are we going to get one of those first off. And secondly, if we had any elite hitting prospects, why would we want to surrender them to get a pitcher we won't be able to afford in two years?  Yes, we would have a fearsome rotation headed by Santana and Bedard, but it is a very, very shortsighted idea that would hurt the team for years to come.  Some people are just plain dumb.

In other news it sounds like the twins have asked all parties involved in the Santana talks to make their final offer. These teams, of course, are the Red Sox, Yankees, and Mets.  There is a<a href="http://gothambaseballmagazine.com/forums/index.php?topic=621.0"> link on </a>mlbtraderumors.com saying the Dodgers are creeping in. There isn't really a source, so I don't believe it.
