After last night's frustrating loss (aren't they all) to those filthy Canadians, Buster Olney showed up on Baseball Tonight and said the Twins have offered Slowey and Ramos for Cliff Lee.  I for one think that is a good deal.  I like Aaron Hicks too much to trade him.  Slowey is a very fine pitcher, but bottom line he is very replaceable.  That Wimmers kid we drafted from tOSU looks like he can do exactly what Slowey has done over the years. 

<em>Aside: I also want to take this time to say that Jack Zduriencik (notice how I used his full name. Why do GMs need nicknames?)  is highly overrated.  Yes, the Mariners improved greatly the minute he showed up, but they were still a .500 non-playoff team.  And it looks like they are going to finish well below that this year.  Good for him, he was able to draft good players, he has had high draft picks and pretty deep pockets. He better draft good players.  So can everyone stop sucking him off and treating him like some sort of deity? Thanks. </em>

What do you guys think? Do you believe this rumor? Is it too much? Not enough?
