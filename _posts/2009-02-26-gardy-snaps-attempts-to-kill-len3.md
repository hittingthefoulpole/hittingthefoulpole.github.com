Here in Internetland, we all respect LEN3 as a good beat writer. That sentiment is apparently not shared by the enigmatic Gardy. <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/02/26/twins-reds-notes-and-lineups/">Tell it La Velle</a>:
<blockquote>I was almost run over by a Jeep Wrangler in the parking lot this morning as I rushed to make a 7 a.m. interview. That’s a little bit of an exaggeration, but the Jeep did throw some dirt on me as I heard Al Green music blaring. The Jeep stopped…and out came Gardy.

“I could have taken your door off,” Gardy barked at me while grinning. The man is always fired up.</blockquote>
Great. In addition to not really knowing what's going on during the game and an unhealthy infatuation with anyone who's proven themselves to be bad at baseball, our manager also has some homicidal lunatic tendencies. At least he keeps it entertaining.

Oh yeah, and check out tonight's lineup against the Reds: 1. Span, LF. 2., Gomez, CF. 3. Harris. 3B. 4. Buscher, 1B. 5. Matos, RF. 6. Dustin Martin, DH. 7. Tolbert, 2B. 8. Jose Morales, C. 9 .Plouffe, SS. Pitching: Blackburn.

Talk about a quintessential spring training lineup. I don't think we'll be going to 2-0. Especially since the Reds are throwing Votto, Bruce, Phillips, and Encarnacion at us.
