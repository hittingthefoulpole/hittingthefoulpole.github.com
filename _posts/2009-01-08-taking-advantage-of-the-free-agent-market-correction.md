FunBobby wrote this morning about <a href="http://firegardy.com/2009/01/08/bargain-hunting/">hunting for bargains</a>, and that more prices may drop as the offseason progresses and free agents actually get worried that they're squeezing themselves out of a job. I think that's more than possible, and it'd be a good thing. Especially for a mid-market team like the Twins.

Speaking of which, remember when we were talking about Orlando Cabrera? The Twins were allegedly thinking about him, before breaking off talks a while back. Well, he's still unsigned, and our fellow mid-market Blue Jays <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3815471&amp;searchName=olney_buster&amp;campaign=rsssrch&amp;source=olney_buster">have this to say about him</a>:
<blockquote>"I like Cabrera, and think he could help us," one highly ranked Blue Jays executive said. "But I cannot justify giving up a pick for a 34-year-old shortstop on a one- or two-year deal. It makes absolutely no sense for us. None."</blockquote>
In my mind, it's pretty likely that the Twins had similar (if not identical) discussions internally, which is why they moved on. Of course, losing a draft pick when signing Cabrera would be even worse for the Twins than the Jays -- the draft pick would go directly to the hated White Sox. We can't afford to let that happen, so we have to walk away from Type A free agents.

And we're not the only team that's thinking that way these days. Most small and mid market teams are starting to put a huge value on their draft picks, in an attempt to stock their farm systems and build a successful franchise, in the model of the Twins (and now also the Rays). As Billy Beane will attest, the most important thing to do is to be contrarian -- when teams were overvaluing batting average and RBI, he valued OBP and built a good team cheaply. Now, teams are starting to overvalue their own farm systems and draft picks, at the expense of aging free agents -- and Beane is making a strong push to take the AL West by spending money.

Now, I'm not about to advocate that the Twins start signing Type A free agents, especially to short-term contracts (the value of a lost draft pick is mitigated if you get many years of high level production out of the free agent -- short term contracts are just foolish in this case). But, again <a href="http://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/562756">like the Blue Jays are hoping</a> to do, it may help us keep our hands on our own guys, and extend them before they reach free agency. By pointing out that they like the city and they like their teammates and they've got a good thing going, and most importantly pointing out that the gap in dollars that we can offer versus the dollars waiting in free agency is <em>shrinking</em>, we become more likely to extend our young players before they get to free agency. Not necessarily the Mauers (though that'd be great), but the somewhat lesser but still important players like Baker, Slowey, and Span.

Even with the economy the way it is and the ownership in transition, there are opportunities out there for the Twins. Whether it's taking advantage of the market to get Dunn on a one year deal, or waiting for Wigginton's price to drop into our comfort zone, or extending our young players before they get expensive, the Twins can make things happen that can help the team today and in the future.
