Lately there's been a lot of talk about Dave Cameron's organizational rankings over at FanGraphs. He's been rating the organizations based on their ownership, front office, major league talent, and minor league talent, in the interest of determining which organizations are in the best position <em>going forward</em> rather than a measurement of past performance. The main problem everyone seems to have with the process is that Cameron is diverging from his typical methods, and instead of using any objective measures is simply going based on his opinions, and ranking the teams essentially randomly, or at best based on personal prejudices for and against the various teams. In this way, he managed to determine that the Seattle Mariners are a better run franchise than the Minnesota Twins, which I'd say is one of the best examples of the absurdity of his endeavor.

While many of us, myself included, have simply been screaming into a deaf windstorm about this, and pointing out the flaws in his methodology and explaining why he ranked individual teams incorrectly, valued Fire Gardy reader thrylos98 decided to take matters into his own hands and actually come up with <a href="http://tenthinningstretch.blogspot.com/2009/03/first-annual-objective-organizational.html">a system of objective measurements to rank the positioning of an organization going forward</a>. Let's take a look.

First, the criteria:
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Front Office: The idea is to create a winning team spending the least amount possible. The metric I am using for this is the sum of a team's wins the last three years (multiplied by 5 to emphasize that wins matter more than payroll) over what the team spent as player payroll to get those wins</li>
	<li>Major League Talent: Remember this is forward-looking. My measurement for this is the sum of a team's wins in the last three years (multiplied by 2 to add more weight to wins, because that's what it matters) over the average age of the team's hitters and pitchers in 2008</li>
	<li>Minor League Talent: This was probably the easiest thing to calculate. I am using the overall winning percentage of an organization's minor league teams. Top prospects and minor league stars are great, but organizational depth is very undervalued and those are the guys who would potentially bail out a team if its starting short stop got a finger caught in a base (sounds familiar?)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
In this way he puts together a system whereby teams can actually be ranked based on ownership/front-office acumen, major league talent, and minor league talent, based on the franchise's ability to <em>win actual baseball games</em>, rather than arbitrary opinions based on secondhand knowledge of owners, executives, players, and prospects.

He ran every team in baseball through his system, and came up with an ordering. If you want to see the intermediate results, I recommend you go and take a look at his article. Here, we're just going to look at the final results.
<blockquote>1. Twins
2. Marlins
3. Angels
4. Indians, Athletics
6. Rockies
7. Rangers
8. Blue Jays,  Red Sox
10. Yankees
11. Diamondbacks
12. Nationals
13. Padres, Giants
15. Cardinals
16. Rays, Mets, Cubs, Philies
20. Brewers
21. White Sox, Braves
22. Reds
24. Dodgers, Royals
26. Pirates
27. Tigers
28. Mariners
29. Orioles, Astros</blockquote>
Given that the system values winning ballgames without overspending, and having an actual core of young players, it emphasizes well-run franchises. Thus it's no surprise to see teams like the Twins, Angels, Indians, and Athletics clustered at the top of the list: these are the best run organizations in the league. And the Twins top the list.

However, the Florida Marlins are #2, and I think that highlights one of the failings of these criteria. The Marlins are generally regarded as a joke franchise, and while the front office does a remarkably good job of putting together a team on a shoestring budget and seem to be constantly generating high-level offensive talent, they're rarely actually a good team. The fact that they spend just $20M on their team, and that their entire team is young (pre-arbitration players are cheap!), <em>really</em> help them fly up the rankings. I don't mean to single out the Marlins (well, maybe a little, but that's not really the point), but I think there's a good way to improve the system that might measure the franchises more accurately.

The system weights wins/$ and wins/age on a linear scale. In reality, the value of wins does not increase linearly as you increase the number of wins. 90 wins is <em>a lot</em> more valuable than 85 wins; a lot more than 5.5% more valuable. What I would like to see is a non-linear multiplier, whereby a higher number of wins gets multiplied by more than a lower number of wins. (Think about it like a progressive tax rate: the more money you make, the higher your tax rate.)

That change would focus the system more closely on the teams that actually contend every year. Doing it on a budget and with a young team would still be valued, but putting a mediocre product on the field would no longer be rewarded just because you do it with 21 year olds making the minimum solely because you're not interested in winning as much as you are in saving money.

I suspect this would push the Red Sox and Yankees a little higher in the top 10, the Twins, Indians, and A's would be largely unaffected, the Marlins would plummet back to where they belong, and the White Sox would probably jump into the top 15 (it would also help the Angels, I suspect).

Also, I don't know if I see the value of minor league winning percentage as an organizational-health metric. It seems to me that a) it focuses on depth at the expense of upside, and b) wins in the minors are largely meaningless. On the former, consider that while there are hundreds of minor leaguers in every organization at any time, there are only 25 major leaguers. It's more important to have a handful of potential superstars than it is to have a gaggle of organizational fillers; and I think this system's reward system has that backwards. On the latter ... consider the case where a team promotes a couple of its good young players from AAA to the majors in midseason. Immediately, that minor league team starts losing more games than it had been (its best players have just been yanked away). That weakens the minor league system in this ranking, when in reality the system had just proved its <em>positive value</em> to the team in supplying good young players. I think this, too, is backwards.

I don't have a realistic solution to the problem of measuring minor league talent across an entire organization. But hopefully by pointing out my problems with it, someone else can come up with a metric that might be better.

So that was an objective look at the health of the franchises going forward, essentially taking another look at the question of efficiency from a different perspective. The Twins, Indians, and Blue Jays were found to be the most payroll-efficient teams in baseball; weighting wins more heavily and valuing youth pushes the Blue Jays down and the Twins up. And like any system that values wins, a low payroll, and a young team, the Twins end up #1.

The Mariners? #28. Amusingly, Cameron couldn't have been more wrong about <em>either</em> of these teams, in opposite directions.
