After the offense awoke on Friday and Saturday, producing 20 runs on the back of 7 homers, including back-to-back shots by Mauer and Morneau on consecutive nights, the bats took a bit of a break on Sunday. Frustratingly, they only took said break with runners on base, as the Twins wasted numerous scoring opportunities in Sunday's series finale against the Mariners.

And the bullpen decided to demonstrate why you can't afford to waste those opportunities, in the course of also wasting a brillian start by Blackburn (7 IP, 5 H, 1 BB, 6 K, 0 R).

For dramatic effect, here is a picture of what "snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory" looks like:
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="This means your bullen sucks" src="http://www.fangraphs.com/lgraphs/290510109_Mariners_Twins_126787629_lbig.png" alt="" width="472" height="300" /></p>

With a 2 run lead in the 8th inning, Gardy took a look at the one of the only two stats managers are allowed to adhere to,* and took Blackburn out given that he'd thrown 99 pitches through 7 innings.

<em>* Managers are allowed to look at "pitch count," and remove the starter at 100 pitches regardless of any other consideration. They are also allowed to look at "saves," and keep the closer -- ie, best reliever -- on the bench in a close game when the rest of the bullpen is failing rapidly and losing the game. Despite the fact that both of these things often lead to losing baseball games, managers are not allowed to change their behavior. Gardy is one of the many blind offenders.</em>

Despite the obviousness of the fact that the Twins' best bet to win games is to have the starter go eight scoreless and then bring in Nathan, Gardy decided to flip a 100-sided die in the hopes that a 13 came up -- in other words, he went to the bullpen hoping for the 1-in-100 chance that they didn't blow it.

Unfortunately, Mijares gave up a Home Run Sponsored By Subway* to Ken Griffey Jr, who has now his two of his three home runs on the season against left handed pitchers at the Metrodome. While I personally find that both interesting and depressing, Mijares looked like he just considered it depressing. He spent the rest of the game by himself on the bench looking like he was unsuccessfully trying to hold back tears.

<em>* Griffey's homer went into that hole that says "Win $25000 from Subway" that's been hanging over the baggy for years. It has always been unclear a) who wins the money, a.1) why it would be important to multi-millionaire baseball players to win $25K, a.2) how it might be decided who else might get the money, b) whether the winnings are awarded in cash or in sandwiches. Unfortunately, none of these questions were answered, because after he did it, Subway clarified that these questions are unimportant because it only applies if a Twins player hits in the hole. Which everyone knows will never happen.</em>

By the way, why is Jesse Crain trying to best himself every time out? And by "best himself" I mean "suck even worse than last time, somehow." He came in, faced three batters, and gave up two line drives, a wild pitch, and a blast off the top of the baggie (which was about as close to a home run as Morneau's earlier in the game).

After that, the Twins looked pretty dejected. Especially Craig Breslow, who really didn't look like he wanted to be in the game while he was sucking in the ninth. The one thing I have to say to him is this: Don't worry Craig, we don't want you in the game either.

This story could have ended with a story about a thrilling comeback victory, except Brendan Harris grounded out with the bases loaded after Morrow lost his command in the ninth. But that failure isn't nearly as bad as the bullpen's.

What can possibly be done about these relievers?
