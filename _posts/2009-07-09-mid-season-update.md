Before the season we here at firegardy (well, I guess just me) made pre-season predictions.  They can be found <a href="http://firegardy.com/2009/04/03/predictions-sure-to-be-wrong/">here</a>.  I'm not doing so well.  The Indians, Cubs,  A's (The A's, what the hell was I on when I wrote that!?), and Mets picks look pretty bad now.  The Yankees and Rays are both in playoff contention, so its still too early to write those off as bad picks.  The Sizemore for MVP pick doesn't look so hot because a) the Indians suck, and b) he has been hurt.  The Grienke for CY Young is still possible.  As is Gardy for manager of the year.  However, its pretty clear that someone like Ron Washington will get that unless the Rangers absolute tank the rest of the year.  My NL MVP and CY Young picks are still possible, but Johan isn't really the frontrunner for the Cy right now.  If he tears it up in the second half as usual, that will help both my Cy Young pick and NL Wild card pick. 

How did your picks hold up?
