For some reason, I feel like bringing up something useless and petty*. This is what happens when the season starts and I go without watching a baseball game for over 24 hours. Watch out people.

<em>* Seriously, what do you expect from me? If you want the news, listen to FunBobby. Something about Humber sucking happened recently, I think.</em>

<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123985205744324009.html">Managers wearing uniforms</a>. Why do they do it? It's difficult for anyone to look good in a baseball uniform (I think baseball started before the word "style" was invented), but it's virtually impossible for a middle-aged former athlete with a beer gut and a sunburn to pull off the look. And it's not like these guys need to be wearing the uniform, it's not like they're going to go pinch run for one of the players.

Rule 1.11(a) says that all members of a team must wear a uniform. The manager is not a member of the team. Just like anyone else at the stadium who isn't a player, he <em>may</em> where a uniform, but he is not required to.
<blockquote>According to an informal look by researchers at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, it's believed that the last manager to wear a suit was Burt Shotton of the Brooklyn Dodgers, who last managed a game in 1950.</blockquote>
So no suits in the last 60 years. But that doesn't say anything about non-uniformed managers, wearing jeans and a polo shirt, or whatever they might find fashionable or comfortable that day.

You might be wondering, as I was, about Gardy's take on this. It is utterly unsurprising that he's a fan of the uniform*, but his response to why he wears it during games: "I hate sport coats."

<em>* We're talking about a former slap-hitting middle infielder who could "play" multiple positions who values nothing more than slap-hitting middle/utility infielders. Is it obvious to anyone else that he's clinging to the past a little bit?</em>

Fair enough, Gardy. But nobody said that was the only other option.

Frankly, I think it's past time managers give up their traditional clinging-to-their-younger-days-by-wearing-the-garb-of-a-20-year-old, just like other people their age, and dress more appropriately. If I may make one stipulation, though, I am not interested in seeing any of these guys wearing shorts.
