The Twins <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/89596502.html?elr=KArksUUUU">announced</a>today that pitcher Gelnn Perkins, and catcher Wilson Ramos will start the season at AAA.  I don't think anyone is surprised by the Perkins news, he has a bad attitude and an arm to match.  The hotter topic is Wilson Ramos. My twitter feed blew up yesterday with various people arguing for and against using Ramos as Mauer's backup for a month.  I am personally in the camp that believes Ramos needs to play everyday, and he will not do that with the Twins.  Yes, Drew Butera does suck immensely, but it is the right move for a few weeks, a month at most.  Some are assuming that Ramos will be a huge asset as a right handed pinch hitter late in close games.  Can we really assume a player with exactly zero major league at bats can come in and hit off of elite, late inning AL relievers?  I don't think we can. Thome crushes righties, and Harris hits lefites well enough to give us a suitable stable of pinch hitters for Gardy to pull from. 

Starting Ramos' arbitration clock is only one of the reasons (and a secondary one at that) he should start the season in Rochester. If he comes up and struggles, who knows what that will do to his confidence.  He has had zero plate appearances above AA, so why rush him? If anyone argues that "Mauer only had limited at bats in AA before making the majors!", I will punch you through the computer.  Mauer was brought up to be the starter, not a backup.  Plus,  Ramos isn't the prospect Mauer was.    What does everyone think of this hotly contested roster move?  Gardy said it was a tough decision, and I'm sure it was.  It was the right one, though.

In other news, Pat Neshek has claimed a bullpen spot. That is good news as he has looked good this spring. I don't think there is much argument here, so I won't waste anymore time on it.
