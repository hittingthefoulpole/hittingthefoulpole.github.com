Game 163 is scheduled to start at 6:30 tonight, in Chicago (which is a travesty I won't address again).  The white sox are starting John Danks against the Twins' Nick Blackburn.  Both starters have pretty ugly numbers against the opponent. Danks is pitching on three days rest, while Blackburn is pitching on five days rest.  Danks has terrible numbers while on three days rest, and given the total number of innings he has pitched this year and given his relative inexperience this can't help him.  That extra day should help Blackburn because he is in the same boat. High innings total, young arm, etc.  Not sure what else to think.  Guillen used four relievers yesterday (Thorton, Dotel, Linebrink and Jenks) I'm guessing most of them will be available today since none pitched more than one inning. I think Thorton only faced a few batters, so I'm sure he will be asked to come in and get Mauer-Morneau out at some point late in the game.

I think this game will be close, but I honestly don't like our chances. We play like children on the road, and Blackburn has been pretty unimpressive in his last few starts. Especially the ones on the road.  Will gardy start Cuddyer against the lefthanded starter instead of Kubel at DH?  Probably. Not sure if that is wise considering the do or die nature of this game.  Also, I think the game is on TBS, not sure if it will be on FSN as well. 

Go Twins.
