On Saturday, <a href="http://ussmariner.com/2009/01/10/the-jan-10-recap-of-sorts/">the new Mariners' regime had a sitdown conference with a few hundred fans</a>; they not only spoke about their upcoming plans for the organization, but also opened the floor to questions. It apparently lasted three and a half hours, with no breaks.

It doesn't sound like they revealed anything Earth-shattering. But I think it's a good show-of-faith on their part, and a great way to get the fans involved. Unless you're saying stuff like "We plan to have an eight man rotation," or "Five infielders and two outfielders is the ideal defensive alignment," or "Felix Hernandez sucks, we're going to cut his ass," this is the kind of thing that can't go badly.

One interesting bit:
<blockquote>Orgs they respect: Twins came up w/r/t scouting and the continuity of philosophy. Atlanta and the continual reloading during contention.</blockquote>
Once again, the Twins are specifically named as the model other organizations (claim) to aspire to. (Although I personally find it amusing that they said they respect the continuity of philosophy in the same offseason that they're overhauling their entire front office and installing a new philosophy -- are they just saying they want to keep their jobs for the next 20 years?)

Would it hurt the Twins to do something like this? I think the fanbase is hungry for more information from the team, and also for the sense of having more input. One of the many old-school philosophies of the Twins is the "We run the team, and you're going to sit there and like it" attitude. It's very Old Media.

Which is simultaneously the reason they <em>won't</em> put on a similar conference and the reason they <em>shouldn't</em> do it. As long as they have that attitude, a conference like that won't work -- what made it work for the Mariners was that the new regime has adopted a sense of transparency. They want the fans to trust them, and they're doing that not by saying "Just trust us," but rather by saying "Here's what we plan to do, here's why, and here's how."

While the Twins are a little bit open to the media (and thus, indirectly, the fans), and we pretty much already know their overarching philosophy and "plan," I simply can't see them opening up directly to the fans like this. Unless something fundamentally changes.

At the same time, though, should something change? Since the Twins are the model for every small and mid market team, all of whom are trying hard to replicate their success and their process, is it really in their interest to open up and reveal their blueprint, regardless of how interested their fans are?

There are times for transparency, and when half the league is desperately trying to figure out how you do what you do ... well, then that's not one of those times.
