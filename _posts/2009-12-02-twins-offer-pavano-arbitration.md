The deadline to offer arbitration to pending free agents was midnight last night.  As expected the Twins <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/12/01/tuesday-update-2/">offered</a> it to Carl Pavano.  Pavano  is a Type B free agent, so if he decides to sign elsewhere the team will get a compensatory draft pick.

This move was a no brainer because if he accepts we have him for one year at a reasonable price, and if he doesn't we get the pick.  Let's just hope Bill Smith doesn't sign him to some huge extension to prove to Mauer "we're building a winner here, and everyone knows Pavano is a winner". That would piss me off.

Polanco and Orlando Hudson were not offered arbitration so the Twins wouldn't have to forfeit a draft pick to sign them.  Thus making them more appealing.  I have always been a bigger Polanco fan than Hudson fan but either would give the Twins a huge boost, adding one of them plus JJ Hardy would turn the Twins middle infield from a huge liability to a strength.  Not sure if I can handle that.  I'm so used to the Twins having really crappy middle infielders, and I don't think Gardy would be happy if we had two GOOD ones.
