Okay, on the heels of the new #firegardy Twitter feed showing up at the top of the site, we have a new toy to roll out to everyone out there.

Because we like to use the comments sections for discussing things, it's useful to know when someone has posted a new comment. I've been following the Comments RSS feed for a while, but that doesn't get updated frequently enough for it to be useful as a realtime comment notifier. You know what <em>would</em>Â be useful as a realtime comment notifier? If you guessed Twitter, you're 100% right.

So that's why I'm here to announce the <a href="http://twitter.com/firegardy">firegardy Twitter account</a>! Once you've signed up for Twitter, you just "follow" the firegardy user (by hitting the "Follow" button on his page once you're logged in), and his updates will come straight to you.

For now, firegardy will tweet every time someone leaves a comment. Later we might add posts, or other stuff. Rest assured, however, that this will not be used as a venue for spam. I hate that crap, and I won't have any part in it. The firegardy tweets are just for useful firegardy-related information.

I'm already finding it useful, and I hope you will too.

Enjoy ... and go Twins!
