Last night, Francisco Liriano turned in an adequate performance -- 6 IP, 3 ER, 7 K, 3 BB -- that isn't going to help him convince anyone that he should be considered for the Cy Young. He struggled a bit with his command, but was hitting 97 MPH with his fastball and 90 MPH with his slider.

In my mind, there were two moments in the game that characterized who Liriano is as a pitcher and represent the arguments of those who say he's clearly in the running as a great pitcher as well as those who say he simply doesn't belong in the conversation.

The first of those moments came in the bottom of the 4th inning. After striking out Alex Rios, he gave up a fly ball by Paul Konerko that sailed to right-center field. Denard Span and Jason Kubel both cruised toward it, and neither of them made much of an attempt to catch it. Kubel "dove" for it (really, it wasn't much of a dive, he just fell down in the direction of the ball at the last second, when he realized Span wasn't going to try), while Span decided to "back up" the attempted catch by running _in front_ of Kubel. When the ball predictably bounced right past Kubel, Span had to chase after it like so many embarrassed and flustered 9 year olds do every summer. Konerko stood at third base.

So after a botched defensive play, there was a runner at third and one out. This is the moment that defines greatness -- you need to get out of this inning. Liriano proceeded to strike out Manny Ramirez; just a fly ball or a ground ball would have scored a run and surrendered a lead. He then struck out Carlos Quentin to end the inning, preserving the 0-0 score. That's the sort of thing Cy Young winners do to win ballgames. This seems like the sort of moment that sticks out in the minds of people who want to see Liriano as a great pitcher.

The second pivotal moment occurred just the next inning. In the bottom of the fifth, Liriano found himself with men on first and third with one out, with Juan Pierre at the plate and long-time Liriano Killer Alexei Ramirez on deck. The best thing you can do in this situation is turn a double play.

Liriano managed to induce a weak ground ball off the bat of Pierre, but it came right back to him. Perhaps he was surprised, startled that he had to defend his position. After a moment of hesitation, he checked the runner at third and got the out at first. The replay showed that neither JJ Hardy nor Orlando Hudson covered second base, but Liriano wouldn't have known that because he never looked. Maybe he didn't trust either of them to make the throw to first base -- they've struggled with that lately. Maybe he figured he could just get the next guy out, so he didn't need to go for the two-fer. But maybe, and most likely, he just went blank in the heat of the moment; he froze, and momentarily forgot that he can get himself two outs, could escape the inning unscathed, could preserve his shutout.

And it seems to me that it's these moments that stick out in the minds of those who want to see Liriano as a guy with good stuff who isn't _a big game pitcher_, a guy they wouldn't trust in Game 7, a guy who can't be an Ace, and shouldn't even be mentioned for a Cy Young award regardless of his numbers.

Not every Cy Young award winner has been Gold-Glove-worthy at defending his position, but Liriano won't be able to silence his critics and convert his doubters unless he's able to straighten out issues like these. For them, it's not his defense that's the problem -- it's his mind.

Is it possible for Liriano to fix that? Is steely composure in the face of adversity a skill, or a natural-born trait that can't improve? Can he minimize the effects of that untrustworthiness, or is that one side of an immutable coin that's essential to who he his?
