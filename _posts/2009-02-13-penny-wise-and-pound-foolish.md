Speaking of Delmon Young, I think we just found out why he's taking whatever endorsement deals he can find before his stardom reaches anywhere beyond FireGardy.com ... the Twins <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/02/13/bankruptcy-no-threat-for-cash-flush-twins/">decided to jack him out of a bit of salary</a>.
<blockquote>Under the collective bargaining agreement, the Twins had a right to cut Delmon Youngâ€™s salary by 20 percent this year. Including his pro-rated signing bonus, he made $1,440,000 last year, so the least the Twins could pay him was $1,152,000.

On Thursday, the Twins signed Young for that amount, exactly.</blockquote>
While I personally think it's a bunch of crap that non-free-agent players can only take a 20% pay cut, and that we're responsible for pro-rating the signing bonus Tampa Bay decided to give him, and that he was <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=2140&amp;position=OF">worth (negative!)$2.4M in 2008 (scroll to the bottom)</a>, this isn't exactly the kind of thing that'll make a player happy.

Given that it was a bit of a struggle for him last year, and he didn't live up to our expectations, I understand that we wouldn't exactly want to give him a raise. But given that everyone else in the entire f'ing league gets a raise, I can also see why he might be a little pissed off that we decided to give him the absolute minimum we were allowed to. Maybe splitting the difference would have worked a bit better? Seriously, we're talking about $150K for a team that's $20M below its budget.

And by doing what we can to save a couple of bucks, we risk awakening the thoughts in Delmon's head that he formerly stated about Tampa Bay; his stated plan to "do [his] six and bolt."

Hopefully this pisses Delmon off enough that he hits a hell of a lot better this year, but not enough that he wants to leave the Twins at his first opportunity. I don't want our players counting the days until they can leave.
