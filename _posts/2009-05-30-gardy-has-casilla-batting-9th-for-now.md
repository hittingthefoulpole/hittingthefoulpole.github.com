Remember this morning when I said I was wondering if Casilla's return would herald Mauer's departure from the second spot in the lineup?

Well, apparently <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2009/05/30/twins-rays-three-doors-down-pregame/">Gardy hasn't gone completely nuts</a>:
<blockquote>Alexi Casilla is here. Heâ€™s in a much better frame of mind than he was when he was sent down. But Gardy has him batting ninth. The manager would love to move Casilla back into the No. 2 spot but wants him to hit his way there first.</blockquote>
Especially with Mauer's added power, I also wouldn't mind seeing Casilla get back into the 2 hole, but he does have to prove he can do it. You prove you can do it by hitting the ball. So hopefully Casilla proves he can hit again, and Gardy sticks to his guns and doesn't move him back up in the lineup until he does it.
