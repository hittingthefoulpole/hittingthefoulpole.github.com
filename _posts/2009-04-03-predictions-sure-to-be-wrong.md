Well, its time for the second annual firegardy.com MLB predictions.  I will lay out my predictions for division winners, world series (but not each playoff round) and major award winners.  Here goes:

<strong>American League</strong>

East: Yankees- I really think their pitching will live up to the hype.  Having CC, Burnett, Wang, Pettitte is a pretty fearsome rotation.  

Central: Indians- This division is a crapshoot.  Top to bottom could be separated by only 5 games.  I'm going with the Indians because if Victor Martinez and Hafner bounce back even a little, they will be dangerous.  And having Matt LaPorta waiting in the wings doesn't hurt.

West: Athletics

Wild Card: Devil Rays- I think everyone knows the AL east will have two playoff teams, just a matter of which two and I like the Devil rays and Yankees and hate the red sox.

MVP: Grady Sizemore

CY Young: Zach Grienke

Manager of the Year: Ron Gardenhire- despite the title of the blog, he is probably due.

<strong>National (children's) League</strong>

East: Phillies- if it ain't broke....

Central: Cubs- This division is pretty bad.  The Cards will be decent because Tony LaRussa could grab 9 guys out of a bar at closing time and finish above 500.

West: the LA Mannys, I mean Dodgers.  This Division is also pretty weak. There is plenty of good pitching, and the Diamondbacks are loaded with young, offensive talent, but I think he dodgers are just too good.  They might have to add an arm for the rotation at some point.

Wild Card: The Mets..... No I'm serious.

MVP: Puljos- not exactly bold, but he is too good to not pick.

CY Young: Johan.

World Series: Yankees over Cubs.  The Yankees are back, for better or for worse.
