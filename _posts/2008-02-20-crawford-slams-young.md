Joe C's got a post today about Carl Crawford <a href="http://nc.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/?p=494">complaining</a> about Delmon Young's maturity level, lumping him in with Elijah Dukes. He was really harsh about it, but I don't think he realized exactly what he was saying.
<blockquote>“They could do whatever they wanted to do and they did whatever they wanted to do. Being loud, talking too much, saying whatever they wanted to whoever they wanted to say it to. There weren’t no rules for those guys. Now they’re going to somewhere where they have rules, so I don’t know what’s going to happen then.”</blockquote>
No rules for two talented young players who clearly need guidance, in the game and in their lives? Now, it's possible that I just like Delmon Young because he's the newest (good) Twin, and I want him to succeed and become a big star who outshines Garza and Bartlett. But <em>maybe</em> there's a reason Tampa Bay has never won 70 games.

A team needs rules. Some rules are stupid (no "bling bling" or windbreakers, despite the fact that the team distributes windbreakers and the goal of every season is to acquire some bling at the end), but having them helps to keep people in line. If Tampa Bay had no rules, then it's no wonder the franchise has been in disarray throughout its history. And I don't want to think about the implication of taking Crawford literally when he says "There weren’t no rules for those guys." Is it possible that these two were the exception to the team rules? Because if that's the case, it's even worse than not having any rules at all.

The Twins are a better run organization than the (Devil) Rays. The sky is blue.

Delmon Young is probably going to clean up his act, and make Crawford look like an idiot.
