Well, leave it to Gardy to screw up the pitching staff as badly as the lineup. <a href="http://ww3.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2008/03/11/twins-leaning-toward-livan-for-opening-night/">Reports</a> <a href="http://blogs.twincities.com/twins/2008/03/livan_to_lead_off.html">are</a> <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080311&amp;content_id=2418707&amp;vkey=spt2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min">coming</a> out today that he's planning to use Livan Hernandez as the Opening Day Starter. That's right. The "ace" of our staff is the fourth best pitcher in the rotation (at best).

Why? you may ask. Why would someone do such a thing. Well, it's quite simple, really.
<blockquote>"He knows how to pitch; he's done it," Gardenhire said. "He's proven himself in this league, and I think he probably has another level. I think we've seen it before, so we've kind of learned not to panic."</blockquote>
It's a good thing "making starts" is more important than doing well in them. (Livan's spring stats: 1-1 with an 8.00 ERA in three starts.) And it's good to know that Gardy values "sucking for a long time" over "performance on the field." I don't even see how the two compare.

Livan has made 8 Opening Day starts in his career, with the Marlins, Giants, Expos, and Nationals. I find it difficult to believe that Gardenhire can't connect the dots here. What do all four of those teams have in common? Do we really want to put <em>Twins</em> on that list of "Most Pathetic Franchises in the League?"

While I don't think there's a clear cut option for an Opening Day starter on this team (because Liriano probably won't be ready), I do think Livan is about the worst option. I'd much rather have Baker, Boof, Slowey, Blackburn, Humber, FunBobby, or my little sister make the first start than <em>Livan Hernandez</em>.

Maybe I'm wrong. But I just get a little more excited about "young guys who look like they might be good" than "old guys who've proven they suck by sucking consistently for 10 years." Gardy clearly disagrees.
