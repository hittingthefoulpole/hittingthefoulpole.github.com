Sirsean and I were discussing the other day the importance of Rick Anderson to the pitching staff.  We decided it was totally overrated.  Now, don't get me wrong, Anderson is a great pitching coach.  However, we feel that he is getting too much credit for the performance of our pitchers.  At least recently.  The five current starters were studs in the minors and continued that success in the majors.  Anderson does a fine job preparing them for games (much like Dave Duncan does for the Cards, for those of you who read "Three Nights in August").  But when it comes to pitcher development, all of that is done by the minor league instructors.  The Twins have some of the best in the business in that regard.  Everyone says "Andy (a terrible nickname by the by, its not so much a nickname as it is just a different name) will work his magic on so and so.  When has he ever done this.  Sidney Ponson? Ramon Ortiz? Livan Hernandez? The only old pitchers the Twins have had in the Gardy years that have been effective have been Rick Reed and Kenny Rogers.  Both were above average when we got them, and just kept doing what they had been doing.  Now, I'm sure developing pitchers is a small part of what a major league pitching coach does.  So I'm by no means calling for Anderson to be fired, but can we stop calling him a pitching God?  He pours over scouting reports with pitchers, and sets up a game plan for how they can use what they have to attack hitters.  Oddly, he seems to preach groundballs, when most of our starters are extreme fly ball pitchers.  When he comes along a pitcher who is more of a strikeout "thrower" (Matt Garza) instead of a control "pitcher" (Kevin Slowey) he doesn't know what to do.  He tries to force everyone into his mold, even if that is not where the pitcher's strengths lie.  It didn't work with Garza or Lohse.  Everyone says it was because they are head cases (you can probably include me in that group).  I do not think its fair to blame a player for getting frustrated when a coach is trying to change his approach this late (late being once he reaches the majors) in his career. 

I am very happy with our current rotation, and how they play the game.  Lets start giving credit to the Cliburn's and all the other minor league coaches, in addition to the credit Anderson gets.  We should also stop assuming Anderson can work his "magic" on any crappy veteran pitcher we sign (RA Dickey, Luis Ayala, etc.) you can only coach up so much talent. 

I'm sure everyone is thinking "Where in the hell do you get off criticizing the best pitching coach in the AL?" Fair point.  I just wanted to bring this topic to light.  Who are some of the other "projects" Anderson has worked on.  Where has he succeeded and where has he failed? Silva is one that comes to mind where he both succeeded and failed.
