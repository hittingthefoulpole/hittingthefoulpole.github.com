According to <a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/neal/2010/01/06/twins-add-a-pitcher-but-its-not-who-you-think/">LEN3</a> the Twins have made no offer to Washburn.  This is excellent news.  Smith has declined to comment, so we aren't out of the woods yet.

We'll keep an eye on this situation, hopefully Scott Boras fabricated the whole thing as a source of leverage for Washburn.
