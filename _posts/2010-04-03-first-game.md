My dad called me this morning asking if I wanted to go to the Twins game today.  I was lukewarm because I didn't want my first game at Target Field to be a spring training game.  He then told me that one of his friends is friends with Tony LaRussa so we could go on the field.  I couldn't pass that up.  I met LaRussa and Mark McGwire.  McGwire came up to us and said "Hi, I'm Mark. Nice to meet you".  Very friendly.  Here are some pictures I took.  Enjoy
