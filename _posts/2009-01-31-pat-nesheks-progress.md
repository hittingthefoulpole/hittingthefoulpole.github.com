Buster Olney recently spoke to Pat Neshek via email, and <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3871494&amp;searchName=olney_buster&amp;campaign=rsssrch&amp;source=olney_buster">published Neshek's response</a>:
<blockquote>"So far the rehab is going good. Right now it really isn't much for rehab -- just a couple exercises that take about 20 minutes to do. I have been in Minnesota since the surgery on Nov. 18th. I will be heading down to Florida on the 14th of February, and reporting at the same time as the rest of the guys.

"My throwing will begin around mid-March, and that is when the rehab starts to pick up a bunch. We should have a pretty good team again this year, everyone is a year older â€¦ I'm crossing my fingers we sign another guy here, but like the past, I think most of our guys aren't expecting anything to happen. I'll be in Ft. Myers [Fla.] all season rehabbing and watching the guys on the Extra Innings package."</blockquote>
My initial reaction is that it's pretty awesome that Neshek seems to be so quick to respond to people via email; I wonder if that will get more common as a younger generation of players moves up into the major leagues. My second reaction is that it'd be pretty cool to have Neshek's email address.

My third reaction is that I should never have an email conversation with Buster Olney, because he seems to publish these things <em>a lot</em>. And I'm a vulgar, insulting person who goes overboard frequently. I don't want that getting out.

What? You wanted me to actually talk about what Neshek said? I don't have much to say about that. It's refreshingly honest, it doesn't seem like he's just spouting the usual "I'm on schedule, leave me alone" cliche. But there's really no news -- we already know he's going to be out all season.

It is interesting, though, to hear from a guy who grew up a Twins fan and is now on the team. He's wishing, like the rest of the fans, that we add another player. But now that he's a player he has a slightly different perspective and a view into the clubhouse. Pretty great. I'm glad Olney violated Neshek's privacy and published this email.

Also, Pat Neshek is now on record agreeing with me that the Twins are going to be pretty good this year. Just wanted to point that out.

On a slightly sadder note, what do you think the odds are that Neshek will fully recover and regain his former effectiveness? Or is he cooked?
