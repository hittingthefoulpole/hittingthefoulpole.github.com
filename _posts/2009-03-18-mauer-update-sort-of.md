<a href="http://blogs2.startribune.com/blogs/christensen/2009/03/18/twins-gm-no-red-flags-for-mauers-lower-back/">Joe C</a> reported today that there are "no red flags" in regards to Joe Mauer's back.  I guess that is good news.  The Doctors say it is nothing surgical (or at least Smith said the docs said this), so hopefully we can treat it and it goes away for good.  I'm somewhat skeptical that it took this long to come out with this news.  However, I won't jump to any conclusions.  Until someone comes out and says "Joe will start the season on the DL", I'm going to believe he will be good to go.  

That being said, if he isn't good to go, I hope they just bring Morales north and don't do something stupid.  Thank God Pudge already signed with Houston, or that speculation would start to piss me off.  Sign Pudge this, sign Pudge that, it pisses me off just thinking about.  

Anyway, that is all. We will keep our eyes peeled for any Mauer news.  Enjoy the first day of March Madness tomorrow.  I'm sure we will all be productive at work these next two days.
