Almost as good as Kasey Kasem's American Top 40, Aaron Gleeman has been producing a list of the top 40 prospects in the Twins farm system.  He came out with his top 10 this week.  Not surprisingly, it was VERY pitching heavy, as we all know the Twins don't have much in terms of young hitting talent.  They are starting to amass some in the lower ranks, but not much that is major league ready.  I was happy to see that probably for the first time since Joe Mauer was a prospect, the number 1 prospect in the Twins system was a position player.  Carlos Gomez took the spot this year, which isn't surprising.  I am very excited about this guy, and blame his terrible numbers with the Mets last year on being rushed through the system and the Mets below average minor league talent developers.  The Mets have really only had two good home grown players in recent memory: David Wright and Jose Reyes.  Three if you count John Maine.  With a half or full season of, well seasoning, Gomez has the opportunity to be a very exciting Jose Reyes type player.  He already has excellent baserunning ability, this is NOT the same thing as speed, and defense.  His OBP has steadily increased over his career at various minor leauge levels, so that is encouraging.  I would say give him a year (or half) in Rochester away from Gardy's terrible treatment of youngsters, and he will be making us say Torii Who? in no time.
