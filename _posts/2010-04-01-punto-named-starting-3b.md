I won't know what has been the less shocking announcement of the week: Ricky Martin coming out of the closet, or Punto being named starting third baseman.  Since the day Hudson was signed and locked up the second base job, leaving only third base open, I knew Punto would be starting there.  Gardy can't have a starting lineup without Punto in it.  I think we all need to accept that, and realize that the rest of the lineup is so good, we can afford to have one black hole.  Last year we had several black holes and won the division!

Harris played really well this spring, so it is a shame that he has to lose the starting job.  Although, can we consider it a loss if the outcome was decided before the game started? Probably not.

As of April 1 the lineup that will take the field next monday in LA will probably look like this:
<ol>
	<li>Span- CF</li>
	<li>Hudson- 2B</li>
	<li>Mauer- C</li>
	<li>Morneau- 1B</li>
	<li>Cuddyer- RF</li>
	<li>Kubel- DH</li>
	<li>Young- LF</li>
	<li>Hardy- SS</li>
	<li>Punto- 3B</li>
</ol>
Pitching: Scott Baker

I don't think Gardy has announced if he will bat Young seventh and Hardy eight or vice versa, but the above is pretty damn close.

Will anyone be at Target Field on the 12th? I for one can't wait.
