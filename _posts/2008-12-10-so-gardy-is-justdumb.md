From Phil Miller's Pioneer Press blog:
<blockquote><em>He backpedaled on his statement last week that Michael Cuddyer, Carlos Gomez and Denard Span will form his starting outfield, basically saying he didn’t realize how that would be portrayed as snubbing Delmon Young. Gardenhire sung the praises of the 23-year-old outfielder and insisted there will be plenty of work for all four of them. He admitted he didn’t make general manager Bill Smith too happy with that. </em></blockquote>
Um, how did he not realize this?  By saying "these three guys are my starters" means that anyone not included in that statement is NOT a starter.  How did he not see that he was calling Delmon Young either a)expendable, or b) a bench player?  Maybe he was excited being at the Fargo livestock convention or whatever the hell worthless winter caravan deal he was at.   I would hope Smith was upset with those statements.  Just by saying those things, he basically decreased perceived trade value.  If everyone else in baseball knows we are "desperate" to trade him, they will sit back and wait for us to accept their offer, instead of continually increasing their offer to outbid everyone else.  Damn you, Ron!

I know most of this is old news, but I was traveling the past few days and haven't really had a chance to address the topics that arose over the weekend, aside from a few comments on other posts.

In other news, I read somewhere, probably on one of the local paper's blogs, that it will take somewhere in the neighborhood of 4MM per year to keep Punto.  That is absurd.  In another display of Gardy not wanting to consult anyone before making lineup decisions in December, he said if Punto returns he is the starting shortstop.  I believe this time last year Punto was christened the 2008 starting second baseman, until he hurt himself doing "Punto things".  So now he is christened the starting shortstop of December, next year it will be third base, moving one step closer to the dugout.  Maybe this is how Gardy benches his favorite players.  Just moves them around the diamond until they reach the dugout.  Instead of, you know, just telling them to sit their ass down.

General winter meetings thoughts:

After reviewing all of the left side infield rumors, I have decided the Twins should stand pat.  The "available" thirdbasemen (Beltre, Atkins, Kouzmanoff, etc) are all priced WAY too high.  Kouzmanoff intrigues me the most because he is in a bizarro-Atkins situation.  His numbers are pretty decent when you get him away from Petco.  However is defense is bad (at best) and we'd have to give up too much to get him.  If the Padres were desperate to dump him for some reason, then we'd talk.  That isn't the case with young, cheap, marginally talented players.  Beltre is the only player linked to us who I consider more than a lateral move from a Buscher/Harris platoon.  His price tag will probably be the highest of them all, too.

Anyway, if anyone else has any thoughts as to what the Twins should do/will do, please post them.
