Well, sort of. He did pitch yesterday. However, he was clearly not ready as he showed almost complete lack of control of his fastball.  He barely threw his slider, which is probably the plan considering the havoc that pitch wrecks on the arm.  He gave up four runs, which is  a lot, but I think the control and velocity will come back. He didn't show any discomfort, which is great.

That is about all that went great, however.  The offense was just plain bad. They seemed to get runners on, but failed to get them over, or get them in.  We hit the ball hard several times to left, but it always seemed to hang up there for Mark Tehan. I didn't see the exact stats on what the wind was doing, but that had to be a small factor.  It seems that when gomez has an 0 for day, the offense follows suit. Except the other night where all of our hits came from the bottom 4 hitters, that was bizarre.

We have the tigers tonight for two, and the (Devil) Rays for two following that.  I hope the Tigers don't snap out of their funk today or tomorrow (or really ever, but that seems impossible).
