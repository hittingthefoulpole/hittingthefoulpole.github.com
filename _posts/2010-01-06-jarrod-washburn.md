According to something called Scott Miller over at CBSsports.com, the Twins have made <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6270335/19371916">an offer to Jarrod Washburn</a>.  Here are the reasons Miller thinks the Twins think Washburn can help the team:
<blockquote>As for Washburn, 35, the Twins view him as a perfect fit in that he is left-handed, he's got a reputation as being a good guy in the clubhouse, he's pitched enough that he can help anchor a young staff and he's an Upper Midwest native (he was born in Wisconsin and still lives in there in the off-season, in Webster).</blockquote>
As you can see, none of those reasons are "he is a good pitchers who can get people out and win games".

I see no reason to sign Washburn if we already have Pavano.  Is Washburn really much of an upgrade over someone like Perkins/Duensing/Liriano (or Manship if you want to include right handers)? I say no.  Especially since the Twins seem reluctant to cut ties with failed free agent pitchers in a timely fashion (see: Hernandez, Livan, and Ortiz, Ramon).  Couldn't you just see the Twins trotting Washburn and his 5.50 ERA out to the mound every fifth day until mid-July? I totally could.

Washburn was excellent for a few months in Seattle last year but he was a) playing in a massive park, and b) had one of the best outfield defenses EVER playing behind him.  Everyone claims his knee injury caused his 7+ ERA with the Tigers, but I think it was a combination of the knee and his inherent crappiness rising to the surface.

What do you think? Would Washburn help the team or are we better off filling in the last rotation spot internally?
