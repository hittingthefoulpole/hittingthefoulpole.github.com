According to <a href="http://twitter.com/ken_rosenthal">Ken Rosenthal's</a> twitter feed, the Twins are going to use a "closer by committee" to start the season.  I think what this really means is they will use the start of the season as kind of an open audition.  If someone stands out they will close for the rest of the season, if not Bill Smith will have to make a trade. I think the best news to come out of this is that they won't be using Liriano.  That issue was addressed the other day on this site, so I won't get into it.

In other news, Jacque Jones and Matt Tolbert were told they will not start the season on the 25 man roster. I don't think this comes as a surprise to anyone.  While he had a good spring, Jones was considered a long shot to make the team out of spring training.  The stars would have had to align perfectly for Tolbert to make the team.  Since Casilla is out of options, there was little doubt that the reserve infielder spot was going to Alexi.  I'm kind of worried that the Twins won't have a real backup centerfielder, that defense could get pretty ugly if it consists of Young, Kubel, and Cuddyer.  And am I the only one who doesn't like the idea of NIck Punto playing centerfield on some days?

What do you guys think of this "closer by committee"?  What do you think of Tolbert and Jones starting the season in Rochester?
