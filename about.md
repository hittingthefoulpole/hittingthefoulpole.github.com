We’ve been Twins fans for our entire lives, and like nothing more than sitting back and enjoying a good baseball game.

Well, maybe there is something: writing about it. Hopefully we can make our love of baseball ring throughout the internet, and make your experience watching the Twins just a little bit better while we’re at it.

Go Twins!
